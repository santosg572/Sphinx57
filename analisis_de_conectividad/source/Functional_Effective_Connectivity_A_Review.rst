Functional and Effective Connectivity: A Review
===============================================

2011

Over the past 20 years, neuroimaging has become a predominant technique in systems neuroscience. One might envisage that over the next 20 
years the neuroimaging of distributed processing and connectivity will play a major role in disclosing the brain’s functional architecture 
and operational principles. The inception of this journal has been foreshadowed by an ever-increasing number of publications on functional 
connectivity, causal modeling, connectomics, and multivariate analyses of distributed patterns of brain responses. I accepted the 
invitation to write this review with great pleasure and hope to celebrate and critique the achievements to date, while addressing the 
challenges ahead.

**Introduction**

This review of functional and effective connectivity in imaging neuroscience tries to reﬂect the increasing interest and pace of 
development in this ﬁeld. When discussing the nature of this piece with Brain Connectivity’s editors, I got the impression that Dr. Biswal 
anticipated a scholarly review of the fundamental issues of connectivity in brain imaging. On the other hand, Dr. Pawela wanted something 
slightly more controversial and engaging, in the sense that it would incite discussion among its readers. I reassured Chris that if I wrote 
candidly about the background and current issues in connectivity research, there would be more than sufﬁcient controversy to keep him 
happy. I have therefore applied myself earnestly to writing a polemic and self-referential commentary on the development and practice of 
connectivity analyses in neuroimaging.

This review comprises three sections. The ﬁrst represents a brief history of functional integration in the brain, with a special focus on 
the distinction between functional and effective connectivity. The second section addresses more pragmatic issues. It pursues the 
difference between functional and effective connectivity, and tries to clarify the relationships among various analytic approaches in light 
of their characterization. In the third section, we look at recent advances in the modeling of both experimental and endogenous network 
activity. To illustrate the power of these approaches thematically, this section focuses on processing hierarchies and the necessary 
distinction between forward and backward connections. This section concludes by considering recent advances in network discovery and the
application of these advances in the setting of hierarchical brain architectures.

**The Fundaments of Connectivity**

Here, we will establish the key dichotomies, or axes, that frame the analysis of brain connectivity in both a practical and a conceptual 
sense. The ﬁrst distinction we consider is between functional segregation and integration. This distinction has a deep history, which has 
guided much of brain mapping over the past two decades. A great deal of brain mapping is concerned with functional segregation and the 
localization of function. However, last year the annual increase in publications on connectivity surpassed the yearly increase in 
publications on activations per se (see Fig. 1). This may reﬂect a shift in emphasis from functional segregation to integration: the 
analysis of distributed and connected processing appeals to the notion of functional integration among segregated brain areas and rests on 
the key distinction between functional and effective connectivity. We will see that this distinction not only has procedural and 
statistical implications for data analysis but also is partly responsible for a segregation of the imaging neuroscience community 
interested in these issues. The material in this section borrows from its original formulation in Friston et al. (1993) and an early 
synthesis in Friston (1995).

**Functional segregation and integration**

From a historical perspective, the distinction between functional segregation and functional integration relates to the dialectic between 
localizationism and connectionism that dominated ideas about brain function in the 19th century. Since the formulation of phrenology by 
Gall, the identiﬁcation of a particular 
brain region with a speciﬁc function has become a central theme in neuroscience. Somewhat ironically, the notion that distinct brain 
functions could be localized was strengthened by early attempts to refute phrenology. In 1808, a scientiﬁc committee of the Athe´ne´e at 
Paris, chaired by Cuvier, declared that phrenology was unscientiﬁc and invalid (Staum, 1995). This conclusion may have been inﬂuenced by 
Napoleon Bonaparte (after an unﬂattering examination of his skull by Gall). During the following decades, lesion and electrical 
stimulation paradigms were developed to test whether functions could indeed be localized in animals. The initial ﬁndings of experiments by 
Flourens on pigeons were incompatible with phrenologist predictions, but later experiments, including stimulation experiments in dogs and 
monkeys by Fritsch, Hitzig, and Ferrier, supported the idea that there was a relation between distinct brain regions and speciﬁc 
functions. Further, clinicians like Broca and Wernicke showed that patients with focal brain lesions showed speciﬁc impairments. However, 
it was realized early on that it was difﬁcult to attribute a speciﬁc function to a cortical area, given the dependence of cerebral 
activity on the anatomical connections between distant brain regions. For example, a meeting that took place on August 4, 1881, addressed 
the difﬁculties of attributing function to a cortical area given the dependence of cerebral activity on underlying connections (Phillips 
et al., 1984). This meeting was entitled Localization of Function in the Cortex Cerebri. Goltz (1881), although accepting the results of 
electrical stimulation in dog and monkey cortex, considered the excitation method inconclusive, in that the movements elicited might have 
originated in related pathways or current could have spread to distant centers. In short, the excitation method could not be used to infer 
functional localization because localizationism discounted interactions or functional integration among different brain areas. It was 
proposed that lesion studies could supplement excitation experiments. Ironically, it was observations on patients with brain lesions 
several years later (see Absher and Benson, 1993) that led to the concept of disconnection syndromes and the refutation of localizationism as a complete or sufﬁcient account of cortical organization. Functional localization implies 
that a function can be localized in a cortical area, whereas segregation suggests that a cortical area is specialized for some aspects of 
perceptual or motor processing, and that this specialization is anatomically segregated within the cortex. The cortical infrastructure 
supporting a single function may then involve many specialized areas whose union is mediated by the functional integration among them. In 
this view, functional segregation is only meaningful in the context of functional integration and vice versa.

**Functional and effective connectivity**

Imaging neuroscience has ﬁrmly established functional segregation as a principle of brain organization in humans. The integration of 
segregated areas has proven more difﬁcult to assess. One approach to characterize integration is in terms of functional connectivity, 
which is usually inferred on the basis of correlations among measurements of neuronal activity. Functional connectivity is deﬁned as 
statistical dependencies among remote neurophysiological events. However, correlations can arise in a variety of ways. For example, in 
multiunit electrode recordings, correlations can result from stimulus-locked transients evoked by a common input or reﬂect 
stimulus-induced oscillations mediated by synaptic connections (Gerstein and Perkel, 1969). Integration within a distributed system is 
usually better understood in terms of effective connectivity: effective connectivity refers explicitly to the inﬂuence that one neural 
system exerts over another, either at a synaptic or population level. Aertsen and Preißl (1991) proposed that ‘‘effective connectivity 
should be understood as the experiment and time-dependent, simplest possible circuit diagram that would replicate the observed timing 
relationships between the recorded neurons.’’ This speaks to two important points: effective connectivity is dynamic (activity-dependent), 
and depends on a model of interactions or coupling.

The operational distinction between functional and effective connectivity is important because it determines the nature of the inferences 
made about functional integration and
the sorts of questions that can be addressed. Although this distinction has played an important role in imaging neuroscience, its origins 
lie in single-unit electrophysiology (Gerstein and Perkel, 1969). It emerged as an attempt to disambiguate the effects of a (shared) 
stimulus-evoked response from those induced by neuronal connections between two units. In neuroimaging, the confounding effects of 
stimulus-evoked responses are replaced by the more general problem of common inputs from other brain areas that are manifest as functional 
connectivity. In contrast, effective connectivity mediates the inﬂuence that one neuronal system exerts on another and, therefore, 
discounts other inﬂuences. We will return to this below.

**Coupling and connectivity**

Put succinctly, functional connectivity is an observable phenomenon that can be quantiﬁed with measures of statistical dependencies, such 
as correlations, coherence, or transfer entropy. Conversely, effective connectivity corresponds to the parameter of a model that tries to 
explain observed dependencies (functional connectivity). In this sense, effective connectivity corresponds to the intuitive notion of 
coupling or directed causal inﬂuence. It rests explicitly on a model of that inﬂuence. This is crucial because it means that the analysis 
of effective connectivity can be reduced to model comparison—for example, the comparison of a model with and without a particular 
connection to infer its presence. In this sense, the analysis of effective connectivity recapitulates the scientiﬁc process because each 
model corresponds to an alternative hypothesis about how observed data were caused. In our context, these hypotheses pertain to causal 
models of distributed brain responses. We will see below that the role of model comparison becomes central when considering different 
modeling strategies. The philosophy of causal modeling and effective connectivity should be contrasted with the procedures used to 
characterize functional connectivity. By deﬁnition, functional connectivity does not rest on any model of statistical dependencies among 
observed responses. This is because functional connectivity is essentially an information theoretic measure that is a function of, and only 
of, probability distributions over observed multivariate responses. This means that there is no inference about the coupling between two 
brain regions in functional connectivity analyses: the only model comparison is between statistical dependency and the null model 
(hypothesis) of no dependency. This is usually assessed with correlation coefﬁcients (or coherence in the frequency domain). This may 
sound odd to those who have been looking for differences in functional connectivity between different experimental conditions or cohorts. 
However, as we will see later, this may not be the best way of looking for differences in coupling.

**Generative or predictive modeling?**

It is worth noting that functional and effective connectivity can be used in very different ways: Effective connectivity is generally used 
to test hypotheses concerning coupling architectures that have been probed experimentally. Different models of effective connectivity are 
compared in terms of their (statistical) evidence, given empirical data. This is just evidence-based scientiﬁc hypothesis testing. We will 
see later that this does not necessarily imply a purely hypothesis-led approach to effective connectivity; network discovery can be cast in 
terms of searches over large model
spaces to ﬁnd a model or network (graph) that has the greatest evidence. Because model evidence is a function of both the model and data, 
analysis of effective connectivity is both model (hypothesis) and data led. The key aspect of effective connectivity analysis is that it 
ultimately rests on model comparison or optimization. This contrasts with analysis of functional connectivity, which is essentially 
descriptive in nature. Functional connectivity analyses usually entail ﬁnding the predominant pattern of correlations (e.g., with 
principal or independent component analysis [ICA]) or establishing that a particular correlation between two areas is signiﬁcant. This is 
usually where such analyses end. However, there is an important application of functional connectivity that is becoming increasingly 
evident in the literature. This is the use of functional connectivity as an endophenotype to predict or classify the group from which a 
particular subject was sampled (e.g., Craddock et al., 2009).

Indeed, when talking to people about their enthusiasm for resting-state (design-free) analyses of functional connectivity, this predictive 
application is one that excites them. The appeal of resting-state paradigms is obvious in this context: there are no performance confounds 
when studying patients who may have functional deﬁcits. In this sense, functional connectivity has a distinct role from effective 
connectivity. Functional connectivity is being used as a (second-order) data feature to classify subjects or predict some experimental 
factor. It is important to realize, however, that the resulting classiﬁcation does not test any hypothesis about differences in brain 
coupling. The reason for this is subtle but simple: in classiﬁcation problems, one is trying to establish a mapping from imaging data 
(physiological consequences) to a diagnostic class (categorical cause). This means that the model comparison pertains to a mapping from 
consequences to causes and not a generative model mapping from causes to consequences (through hidden neurophysiological states). Only 
analyses of effective connectivity compare (generative) models of coupling among hidden brain states.

In short, one can associate the generative models of effective connectivity with hypotheses about how the brain works, while analyses of 
functional connectivity address the more pragmatic issue of how to classify or distinguish subjects given some measurement of distributed 
brain activity. In the latter setting, functional connectivity simply serves as a useful summary of distributed activity, usually reduced 
to covariances or correlations among different brain regions. In a later section, we will return to this issue and consider how differences 
in functional connectivity can arise and how they relate to differences in effective connectivity.

It is interesting to reﬂect on the possibility that these two distinct agendas (generative modeling and classiﬁcation) are manifest in 
the connectivity community. Those people interested in functional brain architectures and effective connectivity have been meeting at the 
Brain Connectivity Workshop series every year (www.hirnforschung.net/bcw/). This community pursues techniques like dynamic causal modeling 
(DCM) and Granger causality, and focuses on basic neuroscience. Conversely, recent advances in functional connectivity studies appear to be 
more focused on clinical and translational applications (e.g., ‘‘with a speciﬁc focus on psychiatric and neurological diseases’’; 
www.canlab .de/restingstate/). It will be interesting to see how these two communities engage with each other in the future,


especially as the agendas of both become broader and less distinct. This may be particularly important for a mechanistic understanding of 
disconnection syndromes and other disturbances of distributed processing. Further, there is a growing appreciation that classiﬁcation 
models (mapping from consequences to causes) may be usefully constrained by generative models (mapping from causes to consequences). For 
example, generative models can be used to construct an interpretable and sparse feature-space for subsequent classiﬁcation. This 
‘‘generative embedding’’ was introduced by Brodersen and associates (2011a), who used dynamic causal models of local ﬁeld potential 
recordings for single-trial decoding of cognitive states. This approach may be particularly attractive for clinical applications, such as 
classiﬁcation of disease mechanisms in individual patients (Brodersen et al., 2011b). Before turning to the technical and pragmatic 
implications of functional and effective connectivity, we consider structural or anatomical connectivity that has been referred to, 
appealingly, as the connectome (Sporns et al., 2005).

**Connectivity and the connectome**

In the many reviews and summaries of the deﬁnitions used in brain connectivity research (e.g., Guye et al., 2008; Sporns, 2007), 
researchers have often supplemented functional and effective connectivity with structural connectivity. In recent years, the fundamental 
importance of large-scale anatomical infrastructures that support effective connections for coupling has reemerged in the context of the 
connectome and attendant graph theoretical treatments (Bassett and Bullmore, 2009; Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Sporns et al., 2005). This 
may, in part, reﬂect the availability of probabilistic tractography measures of extrinsic (between area) connections from diffusion tensor 
imaging (Behrens and Johansen-Berg, 2005). The status of structural connectivity and its relationship to functional effective connectivity 
is interesting. I see structural connectivity as furnishing constraints or prior beliefs about effective connectivity. In other words, 
effective connectivity depends on structural connectivity, but structural connectivity per se is neither a sufﬁcient nor a complete 
description of connectivity.

I have heard it said that if we had complete access to the connectome, we would understand how the brain works. I suspect that most people 
would not concur with this; it presupposes that brain connectivity possesses some invariant property that can be captured anatomically. 
However, this is not the case. Synaptic connections in the brain are in a state of constant ﬂux showing exquisite context-sensitivity and 
time- or activitydependent effects (e.g., Saneyoshi et al., 2010). These are manifest over a vast range of timescales, from synaptic 
depression over a few milliseconds (Abbott et al., 1997) to the maintenance of long-term potentiation over weeks. In particular, there are 
many biophysical mechanisms that underlie fast, nonlinear ‘‘gating’’ of synaptic inputs, such as voltage-dependent ion channels and 
phosphorylation of glutamatergic receptors by dopamine (Wolf et al., 2003). Even structural connectivity changes over time, at microscopic 
(e.g., the cycling of postsynaptic receptors between the cytosol and postsynaptic membrane) and macroscopic (e.g., neurodevelopmental) 
scales. Indeed, most analyses of effective connectivity focus speciﬁcally on context- or condition-speciﬁc changes in connectivity
that are mediated by changes in cognitive set or unfold over time due to synaptic plasticity. These sorts of effects have motivated the 
development of nonlinear models of effective connectivity that consider explicitly interactions among synaptic inputs (e.g., Friston et 
al., 1995; Stephan et al., 2008). In short, connectivity is as transient, adaptive, and context-sensitive as brain activity per se. 
Therefore, it is unlikely that characterizations of connectivity that ignore this will furnish deep insights into distributed processing. 
So what is the role of structural connectivity?

Structural constraints on the generative models used for effective connectivity analysis are paramount when specifying plausible models. 
Further (in principle) they enable more precise parameter estimates and more efﬁcient model comparison. Having said this, there is 
remarkably little evidence that quantitative structural information about connections helps with inferences about effective connectivity. 
There may be several reasons for this. First, effective connectivity does not have to be mediated by monosynaptic connections. Second, 
quantitative information about structural connections may not predict their efﬁcacy. For example, the inﬂuence or effective connectivity 
of the (sparse and slender) ascending neuromodulatory projections from areas like the ventral tegmental area may far exceed the inﬂuence 
predicted by their anatomical prevalence. The only formal work so far that demonstrates the utility of tractography estimates is reported 
in Stephan et al. (2009). This work compared dynamic causal models of effective connectivity (in a visual interhemispheric integration 
task) that were and were not informed by structural priors based on tractography. The authors found that models with tractography priors 
had more evidence than those without them (see Fig. 2 for details). This provides deﬁnitive evidence that structural constraints on 
effective connectivity furnish better models. Crucially, the tractography priors were not on the strength of the connections, but on the 
precision or uncertainty about their strength. In other words, structural connectivity was shown to play a permissive role as a prior 
belief about effective connectivity. This is important because it means that the existence of a structural connection means (operationally) 
that the underlying coupling may or may not be expressed.

A potentially exciting development in diffusion tensor imaging is the ability to invert generative models of axonal structure to recover 
much more detailed information about the nature of the underlying connections (Alexander, 2008). A nice example here is that if we were 
able to estimate the diameter of extrinsic axonal connections between two areas (Zhang and Alexander, 2010), this might provide useful 
priors on their conduction velocity (or delays). Conduction delays are a free parameter of generative models for electrophysiological 
responses (see below). This raises the possibility of establishing structure–function relationships in connectivity research, at the 
microscopic level, using noninvasive techniques. This is an exciting prospect that several of my colleagues are currently pursuing.

Summary

This section has introduced the distinction between functional segregation and integration in the brain and how the differences between 
functional and effective connectivity shape the way we characterize connections and the sorts of
questions that are addressed. We have touched upon the role of structural connectivity in providing constraints on the expression of 
effective connectivity or coupling among neuronal systems. In the next section, we look at the relationship between functional and 
effective connectivity and how the former depends upon the latter.

**Analyzing Connectivity**

This section looks more formally at functional and effective connectivity, starting with a generic (state-space) model of the neuronal 
systems that we are trying to characterize. This necessarily entails a generative model and, implicitly, frames the problem in terms of 
effective connectivity. We will look at ways of identifying the parameters of these models and comparing different models statistically. In 
particular, we will consider successive approximations that lead to simpler models and procedures commonly employed to analyze 
connectivity. In doing this, we will hopefully see the relationships among the different analyses and the assumptions on which they rest. 
To make this section as clear as possible, it will use a toy example to quantify the implications of various assumptions. This example uses 
a plausible connectivity architecture and shows how changes in coupling, under different experimental conditions or cohorts, would be 
manifest as changes in effective or functional connectivity. This section concludes with a heuristic
discussion of how to compare connectivity between conditions or groups. The material here is a bit technical but uses a tutorial style that 
tries to suppress unnecessary mathematical details (with a slight loss of rigor and generality).

**A generative model of coupled neuronal systems**

We start with a generic description of distributed neuronal and other physiological dynamics, in terms of differential equations. These 
equations describe the motion or ﬂow, f(x, u, h), of hidden neuronal and physiological states, x(t), such as synaptic activity and blood 
volume. These states are hidden because they are not observed directly. This means we also have to specify mapping, g(x, u, h), from hidden 
states to observed responses, y(t):

_ x ¼ f(x, u, h) þ x y ¼ g(x, u, h) þ v

(1)

Here, u(t) corresponds to exogenous inputs that might encode changes in experimental conditions or the context under which the responses 
were observed. Random ﬂuctuations x(t) and v(t) on the motion of hidden states and observations render Equation (1) a random or stochastic 
differential equation. One might wonder why we need both exogenous (deterministic) and endogenous (random) inputs; whereas the exogenous 
inputs are generally known and under experimental control, endogenous inputs represent unknown inﬂuences (e.g., from areas not in the model or spontaneous ﬂuctuations). These can 
only be modeled probabilistically (usually under Gaussian, and possibly Markovian, assumptions).

Clearly, the equations of motion (ﬁrst equality) and observer function (second equality) are, in reality, immensely complicated equations 
of very large numbers of hidden states. In practice, there are various theorems such as the center manifold theorem* and slaving principle, 
which means one can reduce the effective number of hidden states substantially but still retain the underlying dynamical structure of the 
system (Ginzburg and Landau, 1950; Carr, 1981; Haken, 1983; Kopell and Ermentrout, 1986). The parameters of these equations, h, include 
effective connectivity and control how hidden states in one part of the brain affect the motion of hidden states elsewhere. Equation (1) 
can be regarded as a generative model of observed data that is speciﬁed completely, given assumptions about the random ﬂuctuations and 
prior beliefs about the states and parameters. Inverting or ﬁtting this generative model corresponds to estimating its unknown states and 
parameters (effective connectivity), given some observed data. This is called dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and usually employs Bayesian 
techniques.

However, the real power of DCM lies in the ability to compare different models of the same data. This comparison rests on the model 
evidence, which is simply the probability of the observed data, under the model in question (and known exogenous inputs). The evidence is 
also called the marginal likelihood because one marginalizes or removes dependencies on the unknown quantities (states and parameters).

Z p(yjm, u) ¼ p(y, x, hjm, u)dxdh (2)

Model comparison rests on the relative evidence for one model compared to another [see Penny et al. (2004) for a discussion in the context 
of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Likelihood-ratio tests of this sort are commonplace. Indeed, one can cast the t-statistic 
as a likelihood ratio. Model comparison based on the likelihood of different models will be a central theme in this review and provides the 
quantitative basis for all evidence-based hypothesis testing. In this section, we will see that all analyses of effective connectivity can 
be reduced to model comparison. This means the crucial differences among these analyses rest with the models on which they are based.

Clearly, to search over all possible models (to ﬁnd the one with the most evidence) is generally impossible. One, therefore, appeals to 
simpliﬁed but plausible models. To illustrate this simpliﬁcation and to create an illustrative toy example, we will use a local 
(bilinear) approximation to Equation (1) of the sort used in DCM of fMRI time series (Friston et al., 2003) and with a single exogenous 
input, u 2 f0, 1g:

_ x ¼ h x x þ uh xu x þ h u u þ x

(3)

vf v2  f  vf hx ¼ ¼ ¼  hxu  hu  vx vxvu vu  x ¼ 0, u ¼ 0

Here, superscripts indicate whether the parameters refer to the strength of connections, hx , their context-dependent (bilinear) 
modulation, hxu , or the effects of perturbations or exogenous inputs, hu . To keep things very simple, we will further pretend that we 
have direct access to hidden neuronal states and that they are measured directly (as in invasive electrophysiology). This means we can 
ignore hemodynamics and the observer function (for now). Equation (3) parameterizes connectivity in terms of partial derivatives of the 
stateequation. For example, the network in Figure 3 can be described with the following effective connectivity parameters:

2 3 2 3 2 3 À :5 0:2 0 0 0:2 0 0 6 7 6 7 6 7 h x ¼ 4 0:3 À:3 0 5 h xu ¼ 4 0 0 0 5 h u ¼ 4 0 5 (4)

Here, the input u 2 f0, 1g encodes a condition or cohort-speciﬁc effect that selectively increases the (backward) coupling from the second 
to the ﬁrst node or region (from now on we will use effective connectivity and coupling synonymously). These values have been chosen as 
fairly typical for fMRI. Note that the exogenous inputs do not exert a direct (activating) effect on hidden states, but act to increase a 
particular connection and endow it with context-sensitivity. Note further that we have assumed that hidden neuronal dynamics can be 
captured with a single state for each area. We will now consider the different ways in which one can try to estimate these parameters.

**Dynamic causal modeling**

As noted above, DCM would ﬁrst select the best model using Bayesian model comparison. Usually, different models are speciﬁed in terms of 
priors on the coupling parameters. These are used to switch off parameters by assuming a priori that they are zero (to create a new model). 
For example, if we wanted to test for the presence of a backward connection from the second to the ﬁrst area, h 12 x , we would compare 
two models with the following priors:

p(h 12 x jm 0 ) ¼ N (0, 0)

(5)

p(h 12 x jm 1 ) ¼ N (0, 8)

These Gaussian (shrinkage) priors force the effective connectivity to be zero under the null model m 0 and allow it to take large values 
under m1 . Given sufﬁcient data, the Bayesian model comparison would conﬁrm that the evidence for the alternative model was greater than 
the null model, using the logarithm of the evidence ratio:

p(yjm ) ln p(yjm 0 1 ) 



¼ ln p(yjm 1 ) À ln p(yjm 0 )

% F(y, l 1 ) À F(y, l 0 )

(6)

Notice that we have expressed the logarithm of the marginal likelihood ratio as a difference in log-evidences. This is a preferred form 
because model comparison is not limited to two models, but can cover a large number of models whose quality can be usefully quantiﬁed in 
terms of their log-evidences. (We will see an example of this in the last section.) A relative log-evidence of three corresponds to a 
marginal likelihood ratio (Bayes factor) of about 20 to 1, which is usually considered strong evidence in favor of one model over another 
(Kass and Raftery, 1995). An important aspect of model evidence is that it includes a complexity cost (which is not only sensitive to the 
number of parameters but also to their interdependence). This means that a model with redundant parameters would have less evidence, even 
though it provided a better ﬁt to the data (see Penny et al., 2004).

In most current implementations of DCM, the log-evidence is approximated with a (variational) free-energy bound that (by construction) is 
always less than the log-evidence. This bound is a function of the data and (under Gaussian assumptions about the posterior density) some 
proposed values for the states and parameters. When the free-energy is maximized (using gradient ascent) with respect to the proposed 
values, they become the maximum posterior or conditional estimates, l, and the free-energy, F(y, l)p ln p(yjm), approaches the 
log-evidence. We will return to the Bayesian model comparison and inversion of dynamic causal models in the next section. At the moment, we 
will consider some alternative models. The ﬁrst is a discrete-time linear approximation to Equation 1, which is the basis of Granger 
causality.

**Vector autoregression models and Granger causality**

One can convert any dynamic causal model into a linear state-space or vector autoregression model (Goebel et al., 2003; Harrison et al., 
2003; see Rogers et al., 2010 for review) by solving (integrating) the Taylor approximation to Equation (3) over the intervals between data 
samples, D, using the matrix exponential. For a single experimental context (the ﬁrst input level, u = 0), this gives:

x t ¼ Ax t À D þ e t 0x ¼ x ~ A T þ e

(9)

A ¼ exp (Dh x )

(7)

ZD  e t ¼ exp (sh x )x(t À s)ds

The second equality expresses this vector autoregression model as a simple general linear model with explanatory variables, x ~ , that 
correspond to a time-lagged (time · region) matrix of states and unknown parameters in the autoregression matrix, A = exp(Dhx ). Note that 
the random ﬂuctuations or innovations, e(t), are now a mixture of past ﬂuctuations in x(t) that are remembered by the system.

We now have a new model whose parameters are autoregression coefﬁcients that can be tested using classical likelihood ratio tests. In 
other words, we can compare the likelihood of models with and without a particular regression coefﬁcient, Aij , using classical model 
comparison based on the extra sum of squares principle (e.g., the F-statistic). For n states and e*N (0, r 2 I), these tests are based on 
the sum of squares and products of the residuals, R i : i = 0,1, under the maximum likelihood solutions of the alternative and null models, 
respectively:

p(yjm ) ln % ln p(yjl 1 , m 1 ) À ln p(yjl 0 , m 0 )  p(yjm 0 1 )  n n ¼ ln jR 1 j À ln jR 0 j 2r 2 2r2 

(8)

This is Granger causality (Granger, 1969) and has been used in the context of autoregressive models of fMRI data (Roebroeck et al., 2005, 
2009). Note that Equation (8) uses likelihoods as opposed to marginal likelihoods to approximate the evidence. This (ubiquitous) form of 
model comparison assumes that the posterior density over unknown quantities can be approximated by a point mass over the conditional mean. 
In the absence of priors, this is their maximum likelihood value. In other words, we ignore uncertainty about the parameters when 
estimating the evidence for different models. This is a reasonable heuristic but fails to account for differences in model complexity 
(which means the approximation in Equation (8) is never less than zero).

The likelihood model used in tests of Granger causality assumes that the random terms in the vector autoregression model are (serially) 
independent. This is slightly problematic given that these terms acquire temporal correlations when converting the continuous time 
formulation into the discrete time formulation [see Equation (7)]. The independence (Markovian) assumption means that the network has 
forgotten past ﬂuctuations by the time it is next sampled (i.e., it is not sampled very quickly). However, there is a more fundamental 
problem with Granger causality that rests on the fact that the autoregression parameters of Equation (7) are not the coupling parameters of 
Equation (3). In our toy example, with a repetition time of D = 2.4 seconds, the true autoregression coefﬁcients are

This means, with sufﬁcient data, area A2 Granger causes A3 (with a regression coefﬁcient of 0.137) and that any likehood ratio test for models with and without this connection will indicate its existence. The reason for this is that we have implicitly 
reparameterized the model in terms of regression coefﬁcients and have destroyed the original parameterization in terms of effective 
connectivity. Put simply, this means the model comparison is making inferences about statistical dependencies over time as modeled with an 
autoregressive process, not about the causal coupling per se. In this sense, Granger causality could be regarded as a measure of lagged 
functional connectivity, as opposed to effective connectivity. Interestingly, the divergence between Granger causality and true coupling 
increases with the sampling interval. This is a particularly acute issue for fMRI given its long repetition times (TR).

There are many other interesting debates about the use of Granger causality in fMRI time series analysis [see Valde´sSosa et al. (2011) for 
a full discussion of these issues]. Many relate to the effects of hemodynamic convolution, which is ignored in most applications of Granger 
causality (see Chang et al., 2008; David et al., 2008). A list of the assumptions entailed by the use of a linear autoregression model for 
fMRI includes

• The hemodynamic response function is identical in all regions studied.

• The hemodynamic response is measured with no noise.

• Neuronal dynamics are linear with no changes in coupling.

• Neuronal innovations (ﬂuctuations) are stationary.

• Neuronal innovations (ﬂuctuations) are Markovian.

• The sampling interval (TR) is smaller than the time constants of neuronal dynamics.

• The sampling interval (TR) is greater than the time constants of the innovations.

It is clear that these assumptions are violated in fMRI and that Granger causality calls for some scrutiny. Indeed, a recent study (Smith 
et al., 2010) used simulated fMRI time series to compare Granger causality against a series of procedures based on functional connectivity 
(partial correlations, mutual information, coherence, generalized synchrony, and Bayesian networks; e.g., Baccala´and Sameshima, 2001; 
Marrelec et al., 2006; Patel et al., 2006). They found that Granger causality (and its frequency domain variants, such as directed partial 
coherence and directed transfer functions; e.g., Geweke, 1984) performed poorly and noted that

The spurious causality estimation that is still seen in the absence of hemodynamic response function variability most likely relates to the 
various problems described in the Granger literature (Nalatore et al., 2007; Nolte et al., 2008; Tiao and Wei, 1976; Wei, 1978; Weiss, 
1984); it is known that measurement noise can reverse the estimation of causality direction, and the temporal smoothing means that 
correlated time series are estimated to [Granger] ‘‘cause’’ each other.

It should be noted that the deeper mathematical theory of Granger causality (due to Wiener, Akaike, Granger, and Schweder) transcends its 
application to a particular model (e.g., the linear autoregression model above). Having said this, each clever reﬁnement and 
generalization of Granger causality (e.g., Deshpande et al., 2010; Havlicek et al., 2010;

Marinazzo et al., 2010) brings it one step closer to DCM (at least from my point of view). As noted above, autoregression models assume the 
innovations are temporally uncorrelated. In other words, random ﬂuctuations are fast, in relation to neuronal dynamics. We will now make 
the opposite assumption, which leads to the models that underlie structural equation modeling.

Structural equation modeling

If we now use an adiabatic approximation { and assume that neuronal dynamics are very fast in relation to random ﬂuctuations, we can 
simplify the model above by removing the dynamics. In other words, we can assume that neuronal activity has reached steady-state by the 
time we observe it. The key advantage of this is that we can reduce the generative model so that it predicts, not the time series, but the 
observed covariances among regional responses over time, Sy .

For simplicity, we will assume that g(x, y, h) = x and u = 0. If the rate of change of hidden states is zero, Eqs. (1) and (3) mean that

h x x ¼ À x0y ¼ v À (h x ) À 1 x

0

S y ¼ S v þ (h x ) À 1 S x (h x )À 1 T 

(10)

S y ¼ Æyy T æ S v ¼ Ævv T æ S x ¼ Æxx T æ

Expressing the covariances in terms of the coupling parameters enables one to compare structural equation models using likelihoods based on 
the observed sample covariances.

p(yjm ) ln % ln p(S y jl 1 , m 1 ) À ln p(S y jl 0 , m 0 )  p(yjm 0 1 ) 

(11)

The requisite maximum likelihood estimates of the coupling and covariance parameters, l, can now be estimated in a relatively 
straightforward manner, using standard covariance component estimation techniques. Note that we do not have to estimate hidden states 
because the generative model explains observed covariances in terms of random ﬂuctuations and unknown coupling parameters [see Equation 
(10)]. The form of Equation (10) has been derived from the generic generative model. In this form, it can be regarded as a Gaussian process 
model, where the coupling parameters become, effectively, parameters of the covariance among observed signals due to hidden states. 
Although we have derived this model from differential equations, structural equation modeling is usually described as a regression 
analysis. We can recover the implicit regression model in Equation (10) by separating the intrinsic or self-connections (which we will 
assume to be modeled by the identity matrix) and the off-diagonal terms. This gives an instantaneous regression model, h x = h À I 0 x = h 
x + x, whose maximum likelihood parameters can be estimated in the usual way (under appropriate constraints).

So, is this a useful way to characterize effective connectivity in an imaging time series? The answer to this question depends on the 
adiabatic assumption that converts the dynamic model into a static model. Effectively, one assumes that random ﬂuctuations change very slowly in relation to underlying physiology, such that it has time to reach steady state. Clearly, this is not 
appropriate for electrophysiological and fMRI time series, where the characteristic time constants of neuronal dynamics (tens of 
milliseconds) and hemodynamics (seconds) are generally much larger than the ﬂuctuating or exogenous inputs that drive them. This is 
especially true when eliciting neuronal responses using event-related designs. Having said this, structural equation modeling may have a 
useful role in characterizing nontime-series data, such as the gray matter segments analyzed in voxel-based morphometry or images of 
cerebral metabolism acquired with positron emission tomography. Indeed, it was in this setting that structural equation modeling was 
introduced to neuroimaging: The ﬁrst application of structural equation modeling used 2-deoxyglucose images of the rat auditory system 
(McIntosh and Gonzalez-Lima, 1991), followed by a series of applications to positron emission tomography data (McIntosh et al., 1994; see 
also Protzner and McIntosh, 2006).

There is a further problem with using structural equation modeling in the analysis of effective connectivity: it is difﬁcult to estimate 
reciprocal and cyclic connections efﬁciently. Intuitively, this is because ﬁtting the sample covariance means that we have thrown away a 
lot of information in the original time series. Heuristically, the ensuing loss of degrees of freedom means that conditional dependencies 
among the estimates of effective connectivity are less easy to resolve. This means that, typically, one restricts analyse to simple 
networks that are nearly acyclic (or, in the special case of path analysis, fully acyclic), with a limited number of loops that can be 
identiﬁed with a high degree of statistical precision. In machine learning, structural equation modeling can be regarded as a 
generalization of inference on linear Gaussian Bayesian networks that relaxes the acyclic constraint. As such, it is a generalization of 
structural causal modeling, which deals with directed acyclic graphics. This generalization is important in the neurosciences because of 
the ubiquitous reciprocal connections in the brain that render its connectivity cyclic or recursive. We will return to this point when we 
consider structural causal modeling in the next section.

Functional connectivity and correlations

So far, we have considered procedures for identifying effective connectivity. So, what is the relationship between functional connectivity 
and effective connectivity? Almost universally in fMRI, functional connectivity is assessed with the correlation coefﬁcient. These 
correlations are related mathematically to effective connectivity in the following way (for simplicity, we will again assume that g(x, y, 
h) = x

and u = 0):

C ¼ diag(S y ) À 2 1 S y diag(S y )À 2 1 

(12)

Z1  S y ¼ S v þ exp (sh x )S x exp (sh x ) T ds

0

These equations show that correlation is based on the covariances over regions, where these covariances are induced by observation noise 
and random ﬂuctuations. Crucially, because the system has memory, we have to consider the history of the ﬂuctuations causing observed 
correlations. The effect of past ﬂuctuations is mediated by the kernels, exp(shx ),

in Equation (12). The Fourier transforms of these kernels (transfer functions) can be used to compute the coherence among regions at any 
particular frequency. In our toy example, the functional connections for the two experimental contexts are (for equal covariance among 
random ﬂuctuations and observation noise, S x = S v = 1):

2 3 2 3 1 :407 :414 1 :777 :784

C u ¼ 0 ¼ 4 :407 1 :410 5 C u ¼ 1 ¼ 4 :777 1 :769 5 :414 :410 1 :784 :769 1

(13)

There are two key observations here. First, although there is no coupling between the second and third area, they show a profound 
functional connectivity as evidenced by the correlations between them in both contexts (0.41 and 0.769, respectively). This is an important 
point that illustrates the problem of common input (from the ﬁrst area) that the original distinction between functional and effective 
connectivity tried to address (Gerstein and Perkel, 1969). Second, despite the fact that the only difference between the two networks lies 
in one (backward) connection (from the second to the ﬁrst area), this single change has produced large and distributed changes in 
functional connectivity throughout the network. We will return to this issue below when commenting on the comparison of connection 
strengths. First, we consider brieﬂy the different ways in which distributed correlations can be characterized.

Correlations, components, and modes

From the perspective of generative modeling, correlations are data features that summarize statistical dependencies among brain regions. As 
such, one would not consider model comparison because the correlations are attributes of the data, not the model. In this sense, functional 
connectivity can be regarded as descriptive. In general, the simplest way to summarize a pattern of correlations is to report their 
eigenvectors or principal components. Indeed, this is how voxelwise functional connectivity was introduced (Friston et al., 1993). 
Eigenvectors correspond to spatial patterns or modes that capture, in a step down fashion, the largest amount of observed covariance. 
Principal component analysis is also known as the Karhunen-Loe ` ve transform, proper orthogonal decomposition, or the Hotelling transform. 
The principal components of our simple example (for the ﬁrst context) are the following columns:

2 3 :577 :518 :631 eig(C u ¼ 0 ) ¼ 4 :575 À :807 :136 5 (14) :579 :284 À :764

When applying the same analysis to resting-state correlations, these columns would correspond to the weights that deﬁne intrinsic brain 
networks (Van Dijk et al., 2010). In general, the weights of a mode can be positive and negative, indicating those regions that go up and 
down together over time. In Karhunen-Loe ` ve transforms of electrophysiological time series, this presents no problem because positive and 
negative changes in voltage are treated on an equal footing. However, in fMRI research, there appears to have emerged a rather quirky 
separation of the positive and negative parts of a spatial mode (e.g., Fox et al., 2009) that are anticorrelated (i.e., have a negative 
correlation).

This may reﬂect the fact that the physiological interpretation of activation and deactivation is not completely symmetrical in fMRI. 
Another explanation may be related to the fact that spatial modes are often identiﬁed using spatial independent component analysis (ICA).

Independent component analysis. ICA has very similar objectives to principal component analysis (PCA), but assumes the modes are driven by 
non-Gaussian random ﬂuctuations (Calhoun and Adali, 2006; Kiviniemi et al., 2003; McKeown et al., 1998). If we reprieve the assumptions of 
structural equation modeling [Equation (10)], we can regard principal component analysis as based up the following generative model:

x¼ ÀWx 

(15)

W ¼ (h x )À 1 

x ~ N(0, S x )

By simply replacing Gaussian assumptions about random ﬂuctuations with non-Gaussian (supra-Gaussian) assumptions, we can obtain the 
generative model on which ICA is based. The aim of ICA is to identify the maximum likelihood estimates of the mixing matrix, W = (hx )À1 , 
given observed covariances. These correspond to the modes above. However, when performing ICA over voxels in fMRI, there is one ﬁnal 
twist. For computational reasons, it is easier to analyze sample correlations over voxels than to analyze the enormous (voxel · voxel) 
matrix of correlations over time. Analyzing the smaller (time · time) matrix is known as spatial ICA (McKeown et al., 1998). [See Friston 
(1998) for an early discussion of the relative merits of spatial and temporal ICA.] In the present context, this means that the modes are 
independent (and orthogonal) over space and that the temporal expression of these independent components may be correlated. Put plainly, 
this means that independent components obtained by spatial ICA may or may not be functionally connected in time. I make this point because 
those from outside the fMRI community may be confused by the assertion that two spatial modes (intrinsic brain networks) are 
anticorrelated. This is because they might assume temporal ICA (or PCA) was used to identify the modes, which are (by deﬁnition) 
uncorrelated.

Changes in connectivity

So far, we have focused on comparing different models or network architectures that best explain observed data. We now look more closely at 
inferring quantitative changes in coupling due to experimental manipulations. As noted above, there is a profound difference between 
comparing effective connection strengths and functional connectivity. In effective connectivity modeling, one usually makes inferences 
about coupling changes by comparing models with and without an effect of experimental context or cohort. These effects correspond to the 
bilinear parameters h xu in Equation (3). If model comparison supported the evidence for the model with a context or cohort effect, one 
would then conclude the associated connection (or connections) had changed. However, when comparing functional connectivity, one cannot 
make any comment about changes in coupling. Basically, showing that there is a difference in the correlation between two areas does not 
mean that the coupling between these areas has changed; it only means

that there has been some change in the distributed activity observed in one context and another and that this change is manifest in the 
correlation [see Equation (13)]. Clearly, this is not a problem if one is only interested in using correlations to predict the cohort or 
condition from which data were sampled. However, it is important not to interpret a difference in correlation as a change in coupling. The 
correlation coefﬁcient reports the evidence for a statistical dependency between two areas, but changes in this dependency can arise 
without changes in coupling. This is particularly important for Granger causality, where it might be tempting to compare Granger causality, 
either between two experimental situations or between directed connections between two nodes. In short, a difference in evidence 
(correlation, coherence, or Granger causality) should not be taken as evidence for a difference in coupling. One can illustrate this 
important point with three examples of how a change in correlation could be observed in the absence of a change in effective connectivity.

Changes in another connection. Because functional connectivity can be expressed at a distance from changes in effective connectivity, any 
observed change in the correlation between two areas can be easily caused by a coupling change elsewhere. Using our example above, we can 
see immediately that the correlation between A1 and A2 changes when we increase the backward connection strength from A2 to A1. 
Quantitatively, this is evident from Equation (13), where:

2 3 0 :369 :370

DC ¼ C u ¼ 1 À C u ¼ 0 ¼ 4 :369 0 :359 5 (16) :370 :359 0

This is perfectly sensible and reﬂects the fact that statistical dependencies among the nodes of a network are exquisitely sensitive to 
changes in coupling anywhere. So, does this mean a change in a correlation can be used to infer a change in coupling somewhere in the 
system? No, because the correlation can change without any change in coupling.

Changes in the level of observation noise. An important fallacy of comparing correlation coefﬁcients rests on the fact that correlations 
depend on the level of observation noise. This means that one can see a change in correlation by simply changing the signal-to-noise ratio 
of the data. This can be particularly important when comparing correlations between different groups of subjects. For example, obsessive 
compulsive patients may have a heart rate variability that differs from normal subjects. This may change the noise in observed hemodynamic 
responses, even in the absence of neuronal differences or changes in effective connectivity. We can simulate this effect, using Equation 
(12) above, where, using noise levels of S v = 1 and S v = 1.252 , we obtain the following difference in correlations:

2 3 0 À :061 À :060 DC ¼ 4 À :061 0 À :048 5 (17) À :060 À :048 0

These changes are just due to increasing the standard deviation of observation noise by 25%. This reduces the correlation because it 
changes with the noise level [see Equation (12)]. The ensuing difﬁculties associated with comparing correlations are well known in 
statistics and are related to the

problem of dilution or attenuation in regression problems (e.g., Spearman, 1904). If we ensured that the observation noise was the same 
over different levels of an experimental factor, could we then infer some change in the underlying connectivity? Again, the answer is no 
because the correlation also depends on the variance of hidden neuronal states, Sx , that can only be estimated under a generative model.

Changes in neuronal ﬂuctuations. One can produce the same sort of difference in correlations by changing the amplitude of neuronal 
ﬂuctuations (designed or endogenous) without changing the coupling. As a quantitative example, from Equation (12) we obtain the following 
difference in correlations when changing S x = 1 to S x = 1.252 :

2 3 0 :053 :052 DC ¼ 4 :053 0 :038 5 (18) :052 :038 0

The possible explanations for differences in neuronal activity between different cohorts of subjects, or indeed different conditions, are 
obviously innumerable. Yet, any of these differences can produce a change in functional connectivity.

These examples highlight the difﬁculties of interpreting differences in functional connectivity in relation to changes in the underlying 
coupling. Importantly, these arguments pertain to any measures reporting the evidence for statistical dependencies, including coherence, 
mutual information, transfer entropy, and Granger causality. The fallacy of comparing statistics in this way can be seen intuitively in 
terms of model comparison. Usually, one compares the evidence for different models of the same data. When testing for a change in coupling, 
this entails comparing models that do and do not include a change in connectivity. This is not the same as comparing the evidence for the 
same model of different data. A change in evidence here simply means the data have changed. In short, a change in model evidence is not 
evidence for model of change.

As noted above, these interpretational issues may not be relevant when simply trying to establish group differences or classify subjects. 
However, if one wants to make some speciﬁc and mechanistic inference about the impact of an experimental manipulation on the coupling 
between particular brain regions, he or she has to use effective connectivity. Happily, there is a relatively straightforward way of doing 
this for fMRI that is less complicated than comparing correlations.

Psychophysiological interactions

Assume that we wanted to test the hypothesis that frontotemporal coupling differed signiﬁcantly between two groups of subjects. Given the 
above arguments, we would compare models of effective connectivity that did and did not allow for a change. One of the most basic model 
comparisons that can be implemented using standard linear convolution models for fMRI is the test for a psychophysiological interaction. In 
this comparison, one tests for interactions between a physiological variable and a psychological variable or experimental factor. This 
interaction is generally interpreted in terms of an experimentally mediated change in (linear) effective connectivity between the area 
expressing a signiﬁcant interaction and the seed or reference region from which the physiological

variable was harvested. At the between-subject or group level, this reduces to a group difference between the regression coefﬁcient that 
is obtained from regressing the activity at any point in the brain on the activity of the seed region [see Kasahara et al. (2010) for a 
nice application]. It is this regression coefﬁcient that can be associated with effective connectivity (i.e., change in activity per unit 
change in the seed region). To test the null hypothesis that there is no group difference in coupling, one simply performs a two sample 
t-test on the regression coefﬁcients. The results of this whole-brain analysis can be treated in the usual way to identify those regions 
whose effective connectivity with the reference region differs signiﬁcantly.

Note that this is very similar to a comparison of correlations with a seed region. The crucial difference is that the summary statistic 
(summarizing the connectivity) reports effective connectivity, not functional connectivity. This means that it is not confounded by 
differences in signal or noise, and (under the simple assumptions of a psychophysiological interaction model) can be interpreted as a 
change in coupling. It should be said that there are many qualiﬁcations to the use of these simple linear models of effective connectivity 
(because they belong to the class of structural equation or regression models; Friston et al., 1997). However, psychophysiologic 
interactions are simple, intuitive, and (mildly) principled. Further, because the ﬂuctuations in the physiological measure are typically 
slow in resting-state studies, the usual caveats of hemodynamic convolution can be ignored.

Summary

This section has tried to place different analyses of connectivity in relation to each other. The most prevalent approaches to effective 
connectivity analysis are DCM, structural equation modeling, and Granger causality. All have enjoyed a rapid uptake over the past decade 
(see Fig. 4). This didactic (and polemic) treatment has highlighted some of the implicit and implausible assumptions made when applying 
structural equation modeling and Granger causality to fMRI time series. I personally ﬁnd the recent upsurge of Granger causality in fMRI 
worrisome, and it is difﬁcult to know what to do when asked to review these articles. In practice, I generally just ask authors to qualify 
their conclusions by listing the assumptions that underlie their analysis. On the one hand, it is important that people are not discouraged 
from advancing and applying classical time series analyses to fMRI. On the other hand, the persistent use of models and procedures that are 
not ﬁt for purpose may confound scientiﬁc progress in the long term. Perhaps, having written this, people will exclude me from reviewing 
their articles on Granger causality and I will no longer have to worry about these things. On a more constructive note, casting Granger 
causality as a time-ﬁnessed measure of functional connectivity may highlight its potentially useful role in identifying distributed 
networks for subsequent analyses of effective connectivity.

In summary, we have considered some of the practical issues that attend the analysis of functional and effective connectivity and have 
exposed the assumptions on which different approaches are based. We have seen that there is a complicated relationship between functional 
connectivity and the underlying effective connectivity. We have touched on the difﬁculties of interpreting differences in correlations and 
have described one simple solution. In the remainder of this review, we will focus on generative models of distributed brain responses and 
consider some of the exciting developments in this ﬁeld.

Modeling Distributed Neuronal Systems

This section considers the modeling of distributed dynamics in more general terms. Biophysical models of neuronal dynamics are usually used 
for one of two things: either to understand the emergent properties of neuronal systems or as observation models for measured neuronal 
responses. We discuss examples of both. In terms of emergent behaviors, we will consider dynamics on structure (Bressler and Tognoli, 2006; 
Buice and Cowan, 2009; Coombes and Doole, 1996; Freeman, 1994, 2005; Kriener et al., 2008; Robinson et al., 1997; Rubinov et al., 2009; 
Tsuda, 2001) and how this behavior has been applied to characterizing autonomous or endogenous ﬂuctuations in fMRI (e.g., Deco et al., 
2009, 2011; Ghosh et al., 2008; Honey et al., 2007, 2009). We will then consider causal models that are used to explain empirical 
observations. This section concludes with recent advances in DCM of directed neuronal interactions that support endogenous ﬂuctuations. 
The ﬁrst half of this section is based on Friston and Dolan (2010), to which readers are referred for more detail.

Modeling autonomous dynamics

There has been a recent upsurge in studies of fMRI signal correlations observed while the brain is at rest (Biswal et al.,

1995). These patterns reﬂect anatomical connectivity (Greicius et al., 2009; Pawela et al., 2008) and can be characterized in terms of 
remarkably reproducible spatial modes (restingstate or intrinsic networks). One of these modes recapitulates the pattern of deactivations 
observed across a range of activation studies (the default mode; Raichle et al., 2001). These studies show that even at rest endogenous 
brain activity is selforganizing and highly structured. There are many questions about the genesis of autonomous dynamics and the 
structures that support them. Some of the more interesting come from computational anatomy and neuroscience. The emerging picture is that 
endogenous ﬂuctuations are a consequence of dynamics on anatomical connectivity structures with particular scale-invariant and small-world 
characteristics (Achard et al., 2006; Bassett et al., 2006; Deco et al., 2009; Honey et al., 2007). These are well-studied and universal 
characteristics of complex systems and suggest that we may be able to understand the brain in terms of universal phenomena (Sporns, 2010). 
For example, Buice and Cowan (2009) model neocortical dynamics using ﬁeld-theoretic methods (from nonequilibrium statistical processes) to 
describe both neural ﬂuctuations and responses to stimuli. In their models, the density and extent of lateral cortical interactions induce 
a region of state space, in which the effects of ﬂuctuations are negligible. However, as the generation and decay of neuronal activity 
comes into balance, there is a transition into a regime of critical ﬂuctuations. These models suggest that the scaling laws found in many 
measurements of neocortical activity are consistent with the existence of phase-transitions at a critical point. They also speak to larger 
questions about how the brain maintains itself near phase-transitions (i.e., self-organized criticality and gain control; Abbott et al., 
1997; Kitzbichler et al., 2009). This is an important issue because systems near phase-transitions show universal phenomena (Jirsa et al., 
1994; Jirsa and Haken, 1996; Jirsa and Kelso, 2000; Tognoli and Kelso, 2009; Tschacher and Haken, 2007). Although many people argue for 
criticality and power law effects in large-scale cortical activity (e.g., Freyer et al., 2009; Kitzbichler et al., 2009; LinkenkaerHansen 
et al., 2001; Stam and de Bruin, 2004), other people do not (Bedard et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2007; Touboul and Destexhe, 2009). It may 
be that slow (electrophysiological) frequencies contain critical oscillations, whereas high-frequency coherent oscillations may reﬂect 
other dynamical processes. In summary, endogenous ﬂuctuations may be one way in which anatomy is expressed through dynamics. They also 
pose interesting questions about how ﬂuctuations shape evoked responses (e.g., Hesselmann et al., 2008) and vice versa (e.g., Bianciardi 
et al., 2009).

Dynamical approaches to understanding phenomena in neuroimaging data focus on emergent behaviors and the constraints under which brain-like 
behaviors manifest (e.g., Breakspear and Stam, 2005; Alstott et al., 2009). In the remainder of this section, we turn to models that try to 
explain observed neuronal activity directly. This rests on model ﬁtting or inversion. Model inversion is important. To date, most efforts 
in computational neuroscience have focused on generative models of neuronal dynamics (which deﬁne a mapping from causes to neuronal 
dynamics). The inversion of these models (the mapping from neuronal dynamics to their causes) now allows one to test different models 
against empirical data. This is best exempliﬁed by model selection as discussed in the previous section. In what follows, we will

consider two key classes of probabilistic generative modelsnamely, structural and dynamic causal models.

Structural causal modeling

As noted by Valde´s-Sosa et al. (2011), ‘‘despite philosophical disagreements about the study of causality, there seems to be a consensus 
that causal modeling is a legitimate statistical enterprise.’’ One can differentiate two streams of statistical causal modeling: one based 
on Bayesian dependency graphs or graphical models called structural causal modeling (White and Lu, 2010), and the other based on causal 
inﬂuences over time, which we will consider under DCM (see Fig. 5).

Graphical models and Bayesian networks. Structural causal modeling originated with structural equation modeling (Wright, 1921) and uses 
graphical models (Bayesian dependency graphs or Bayes nets) in which direct causal links are encoded by directed edges (Lauritzen, 1996; 
Pearl, 2000; Spirtes et al., 2000). Model comparison procedures are then used to discover the best model (graph) given some data. However, 
there may be many models with the same evidence. In this case, the search produces an equivalence class of models with the same explanatory 
power. This degeneracy has been highlighted by Ramsey et al. (2010) in the setting of effective connectivity analysis.

An essential part of network discovery in structural causal modeling is the concept of intervention—namely, eliminating connections in the 
graph and setting certain nodes to given values. The causal calculus based on graphical models has some important connections to the 
distinction between functional and effective connectivity and provides an elegant framework within which one can deal with interventions. 
However, it is limited in two respects. First, it is restricted to discovering conditional independencies in directed acyclic graphs (DAG). 
This is problematic because the brain is a directed cyclic graph. Every brain region is connected reciprocally (at least polysynaptically), 
and every computational theory of brain function rests on some form of reciprocal or reentrant message passing. Second, the calculus 
ignores

time. Pearl argues that a causal model should rest on functional relationships between variables. However, these functional relationships 
cannot deal with (cyclic) feedback loops (as in Fig. 3). In fact, DCM was invented to address these limitations. Pearl (2000) argues in 
favor of dynamic causal models when attempting to identify hysteresis effects, where causal inﬂuences depend on the history of the system. 
Interestingly, the DAG restriction can be ﬁnessed by considering dynamics and temporal precedence within structural causal modeling. This 
is because the arrow of time can be used to convert a directed cyclic graph into an acyclic graph when the nodes are deployed over 
successive time points. This leads to structural equation modeling with time-lagged data and related autoregression models, such as those 
employed by Granger causality. As established in the previous section, these can be regarded as discrete time formulations of dynamic 
causal models in continuous time.

Dynamic causal modeling

DCM refers to the (Bayesian) inversion and comparison of dynamic models that cause observed data. These models can be regarded as 
state-space models expressed as (ordinary, stochastic, or random) differential equations that govern the motion of hidden 
neurophysiological states. Usually, these models are also equipped with an observer function that maps from hidden states to observed 
signals [see Equation (1)]. The basic idea behind DCM is to formulate one or more models of how data are caused in terms of a network of 
distributed sources. These sources talk to each other through parameterized connections and inﬂuence the dynamics of hidden states that 
are intrinsic to each source. Model inversion provides estimates of their parameters (such as extrinsic connection strengths and intrinsic 
or synaptic parameters) and the model evidence.

DCM was originally introduced for fMRI using a simple state-space model based on a bilinear approximation to the underlying equations of 
motion that couple neuronal states in different brain regions (Friston et al., 2003). Importantly, these DCMs are generalizations of the 
conventional

convolution model used to analyze fMRI data. The only difference is that one allows for hidden neuronal states in one part of the brain to 
be inﬂuenced by neuronal states elsewhere. In this sense, they are biophysically informed multivariate analyses of distributed brain 
responses.

Most DCMs consider point sources for fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data (c.f., equivalent current 
dipoles) and are formally equivalent to the graphical models used in structural causal modeling. However, in DCM, they are used as explicit 
gener-

ative models of observed responses. Inference on the coupling within and between nodes (brain regions) is generally based on perturbing the 
system and trying to explain the observed responses by inverting the model. This inversion furnishes posterior or conditional probability 
distributions over unknown parameters (e.g., effective connectivity) and the model evidence for model comparison (Penny et al., 2004). The 
power of Bayesian model comparison, in the context of DCM, has become increasingly evident. This now represents one of the most important 
applications of DCM and allows different

hypotheses to be tested, where each DCM corresponds to a speciﬁc hypothesis about functional brain architectures (e.g., Acs and Greenlee, 
2008; Allen et al., 2008; Grol et al., 2007; Heim et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2006; Stephan et al., 2007; Summerﬁeld and Koechlin, 2008). 
Although DCM is probably best known through its application to fMRI, more recent applications have focused on neurobiologically plausible 
models of electrophysiological dynamics. Further, different data features (e.g., event-related potentials [ERPs] or induced responses) can 
be modeled with the same DCM. Figures 6–8 illustrate some key developments in DCM. I will brieﬂy review these developments and then 
showcase them thematically by focusing on forward and backward connections among hierarchical cortical areas.

Neural-mass models. More recent efforts have focused on DCMs for electromagnetic (EEG and MEG) data (Chen et al., 2008; Clearwater et al., 
2008; David et al., 2006; Garrido et al., 2007a,b, 2008; Kiebel et al., 2006, 2007), with related developments to cover local ﬁeld 
potential recordings (Moran et al., 2007, 2008). These models are more sophisticated than the neuronal models for fMRI and are based on 
neuralmass or mean-ﬁeld models of interacting neuronal populations (see Deco et al., 2008). Typically, each source of electromagnetic 
activity is modeled as an equivalent current dipole (or small cortical patch) whose activity reﬂects the depolarization of three 
populations (usually one inhibitory and two excitatory). Importantly, one can embed any neuralmass model into DCM. These can include models 
based on

second-order linear differential equations (Jansen and Rit, 1995; Lopes da Silva et al., 1974). Figure 6 shows the general form for these 
models. As in fMRI, DCM for electromagnetic responses is just a generalization of conventional (equivalent current dipole) models that have 
been endowed with parameterized connections among and within sources (David et al., 2006). These models fall into the class of 
spatiotemporal dipole models (Scherg and Von Cramon, 1985) and enable the entire time-series over peristimulus time to inform parameter 
estimates and model evidence. The construct validity of these models calls on established electrophysiological phenomena and metrics of 
coupling (e.g., David and Friston, 2003; David et al., 2004). Their predictive validity has been established using paradigms like the 
mismatch negativity (Na¨a¨ta¨nen, 2003) as an exemplar sensory learning paradigm (e.g., Garrido et al., 2007b, 2008).

Developments in this area have been rapid and can be summarized along two lines. First, people have explored more realistic neural-mass 
models based on nonlinear differential equations whose states correspond to voltages and conductances (Morris and Lecar, 1981). This allows 
one to formulate DCMs in terms of well-characterized synaptic dynamics and to model different types of receptor-mediated currents 
explicitly. Further, conventional neural-mass modeling (which considers only the average state of a neuronal ensemble) has been extended to 
cover ensemble dynamics in terms of population densities. This involves modeling not only the average but also the dispersion or covariance 
among the states of different populations (Marreiros et al., 2009). The second line of development pertains to the particular data features 
the models try to explain. In conventional DCMs for ERPs, the time course of signals at the sensors is modeled explicitly.

However, DCMs for spectral responses (Moran et al., 2007, 2008) can be applied to continuous recordings of arbitrary length. This modeling 
initiative rests on a linear-systems approach to the underlying neural-mass model to give a predicted spectral response for unknown but 
parameterized ﬂuctuations. This means that given the spectral proﬁle of electrophysiological recordings one can estimate the coupling 
among different sources and the spectral energy of neuronal and observation noise generating observed spectra. This has proved particularly 
useful for local ﬁeld potentials and has been validated using animal models and psychopharmacological constructs (Moran et al., 2008, 
2009). Finally, there are DCMs for induced responses (Chen et al., 2008). Like steady-state models, these predict the spectral density of 
responses, but in a time-dependent fashion. The underlying neural model here is based on the bilinear approximation above. The key beneﬁt 
of these models is that one can quantify the evidence for between-frequency coupling among sources, relative to homologous models 
restricted to within-frequency coupling. Coupling between frequencies corresponds to nonlinear coupling. Being able to detect nonlinear 
coupling is important because it speaks to the functional asymmetries between forward and backward connections.

Forward and backward connections in the brain

To provide a concrete example of how these developments have been used to build a picture of distributed processing in the brain, we focus 
on the role of forward and backward message-passing among hierarchically deployed cortical areas (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991). Many 
current formulations of perceptual inference and learning can be cast in terms of minimizing prediction error (e.g., Ballard et al., 1983; 
Dayan et al., 1995; Mumford, 1992; Murray et al., 2002; Rao and Ballard, 1998) or, more generally, surprise (Friston et al., 2006). The 
predictive coding hypothesis { suggests that prediction errors are passed forward from lower levels of sensory hierarchies to higher levels 
to optimize representations in the brain’s generative model of its world. Predictions based on these representations are then passed down 
backward connections to suppress or explain away prediction errors. This message-passing scheme rests on reciprocal or recurrent 
self-organized dynamics that necessarily involve forward and backward connections. There are some key predictions that arise from this 
scheme. First, top-down inﬂuences mediated by backward connections should have a tangible inﬂuence on evoked responses that are modulated 
by prior expectations induced by priming and attention. Second, the excitatory inﬂuences of forward (glutamatergic) connections must be 
balanced by the (polysynaptic) inhibitory inﬂuence of backward connections; this completes the feedback loop suppressing prediction error. 
Third, backward connections should involve nonlinear or modulatory effects because it is these, and only these, that model nonlinearities 
in the world that generate sensory input.

These functionally grounded attributes of forward and backward connections, and their asymmetries, are the sorts of things for which DCM 
was designed to test. A fairly com-

prehensive picture is now emerging from DCM studies using several modalities and paradigms: Initial studies focused on attentional 
modulation in visual processing. These studies conﬁrmed that the attentional modulation of visually evoked responses throughout the visual 
hierarchy could be accounted for by changes in the strength of connections mediated by attentional set (Friston et al., 2003). In other 
words, no extra input was required to explain attention-related responses; these were explained sufﬁciently by recurrent dynamics among 
reciprocally connected areas whose inﬂuence on each other increased during attentive states.

More recently, the temporal anatomy of forward and backward inﬂuences has been addressed using DCM for ERPs. Garrido et al. (2007a)used 
Bayesian model comparisontoshowthat the evidence for backward connections was more pronounced in later components of ERPs. Put another way, 
backward connections are necessary to explain late or endogenous response components in simple auditory ERPs. Garrido et al. (2008) then 
went on to ask whether one could understand repetition suppression in terms of changes in forward and backward connection strengths that 
are entailed by predictive coding. DCM showed that repetition suppression, of the sort that might underlie the mismatch negativity 
(Na¨a¨ta¨nen, 2003), could be explained purely in terms of a change in forward and backward connections with repeated exposure to a 
particular stimulus. Further, by using functional forms for the repetition-dependent changes in coupling strength, Garrido et al. (2009) 
showed that changes in extrinsic (cortico-cortical) coupling were formally distinct from intrinsic (within area) coupling. This was 
consistent with theoretical predictions about changes in postsynaptic gain with surprise and distinct changes in synaptic efﬁcacy 
associated with learning under predictive coding.

Figure 7 shows an exemplar analysis using the data reported in Garrido et al. (2008). Data were acquired under a mismatch negativity 
paradigm using standard and deviant stimuli. ERPs for deviant stimuli are shown as an insert. These data were modeled with a series of 
equivalent current dipoles (upper left), with connectivity structures shown on the lower left. The architecture with backward (reciprocal) 
connections among auditory sources had the greatest evidence. The ensuing estimates of hidden states (depolarization in the auditory and 
superior temporal sources) are shown in the right panels. Dotted lines show the responses of the (excitatory) input population (assigned to 
the granular layer of cortex), and solid lines show the responses of the (excitatory) output population (assigned to pyramidal cells). One 
can see a clear difference in responses to standard (blue lines) and deviant (red lines) stimuli, particularly at around 200300 ms. These 
differences were modeled in terms of stimulus-speciﬁc changes in coupling that can be thought of as mediating sensory learning. The key 
point illustrated by this ﬁgure lies in the rightmost panels. Because analyses of effective connectivity are based on an explicit 
generative model, one can reconstitute or generate predictions of hidden states (in this example, the activity of hidden dipolar sources on 
the cortex). Further, one can perform simulated lesion experiments to see what would happen if particular components of the network were 
removed. This enables one to quantify the contribution of speciﬁc connections to regional responses. In
Figure 7, we have removed all backward connections, while leaving forward connections unchanged. The resulting responses are shown in the 
right panels. One obvious effect is

hat there is now no difference between the responses to standard and deviant stimuli in the primary auditory source. This is because the 
effects of repetition were restricted to extrinsic connections among sources, and (in the absence of backward connections) these effects 
cannot be expressed in the sensory source receiving auditory input. More importantly, in the superior temporal source, the late deviant 
event-related component has now disappeared. It is this component that is usually associated with the mismatch negativity, which suggests 
that the mismatch negativity per se rests, at least in part, on backward extrinsic connections. This example is presented to illustrate the 
potential usefulness of biologically grounded generative models to explain empirical data.

Finally, Chen et al. (2009) addressed functional asymmetries in forward and backward connections during face perception, using DCM for 
induced responses. These asymmetries were expressed in terms of nonlinear or crossfrequency coupling, where high frequencies in a lower 
area excited low frequencies in a higher area and the reciprocal inﬂuences where inhibitory (see Fig. 8). These results may be related to 
the differential expression of gamma activity in superﬁcial and deep pyramidal cells that are the origin of forward and backward 
connections, respectively (see Chrobak and Buzsaki, 1998; Fries, 2009; Roopun et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010). The emerging story here is 
that forward connections may employ predominantly fast (gamma) frequencies, while backward inﬂuences may be meditated by slower (beta) 
activity.

In conclusion, we have come some way in terms of understanding the functional anatomy of forward and backward connections in the brain. 
Interestingly, some of the more compelling insights have been obtained by using biophysical models with simple paradigms (like the mismatch 
negativity) and simple noninvasive techniques (like EEG). All of the examples so far have used evoked or induced responses to make 
inferences about distributed processing. Can we apply DCM to autonomous or endogenous activity and still ﬁnd evidence for structured 
hierarchical processing?

Network discovery

DCM is usually portrayed as a hypothesis-led approach to understanding distributed neuronal architectures underlying observed brain 
responses (Friston et al., 2003). In general, competing hypotheses are framed in terms of different networks or graphs, and Bayesian model 
selection is used to quantify the evidence for one network (hypothesis) over another (Penny et al., 2004). However, in recent years, the 
number of models over which people search (the model-space) has grown enormously—to the extent that DCM is now used to discover the best 
model over very large model-spaces (e.g., Penny et al., 2010; Stephan et al., 2009). Using DCMs based on random differential equations, it 
is now possible to take this discovery theme one step further and disregard prior knowledge about the experimental causes of observed 
responses to make DCM entirely data-led. This enables network discovery using observed responses during both activation studies and 
(task-free) studies of endogenous activity (Biswal et al., 1995).

This form of network discovery uses Bayesian model selection to identify the sparsity structure (absence of edges or connections) in a 
dependency graph that best explains

observed time-series (Friston et al., 2010). The implicit adjacency matrix speciﬁes the form of the network (e.g., cyclic or acyclic) and 
its graph-theoretical attributes (e.g., degree distribution). Crucially, this approach can be applied to experimentally evoked responses 
(activation studies) or endogenous activity in task-free (resting-state) fMRI studies. Unlike structural causal modeling, DCM permits 
searches over cyclic graphs. Further, it eschews (implausible) Markovian assumptions about the serial independence of random ﬂuctuations. 
The scheme furnishes a network description of distributed activity in the brain that is optimal in the sense of having the greatest 
conditional probability (relative to other networks).

To illustrate this approach, Figure 9 shows an example of network discovery following a search over all sparsity structures (combinations 
of connections), under the constraint that all connections were reciprocal (albeit directional), among six nodes or regions. This example 
used DCM for fMRI and an attention-to-motion paradigm [see Friston et al. (2010) for details]. Six representative regions were deﬁned as 
clusters of contiguous voxels surviving an (omnibus) F-test for all effects of interest at p < 0.001 (uncorrected) in a conventional 
statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis. These regions were chosen to cover a distributed network (of largely association cortex) in 
the right hemisphere, from visual cortex to frontal eye ﬁelds. The activity of each region (node) was summarized with its principal 
eigenvariate to ensure an optimum weighting of contributions from each voxel within the region of interest. Figure 9 summarizes the results 
of post hoc model selection. The upper left panel shows the log-evidence proﬁle over the 32,768 models considered (reﬂecting all possible 
combinations of bidirectional edges among the six nodes analyzed). There is a reasonably clear optimum model. This is evident if we plot 
the implicit log-posterior as a model posterior (assuming ﬂat priors over models), as shown in the upper right panel. In this case, we can 
be over 80% certain that a speciﬁc network generated the observed fMRI data. Parameter estimates of the connections under a model with 
full connectivity (left) and the selected model (right) are shown in the lower panels. One can see that three (bidirectional) connections 
have been ‘‘switched off.’’ It is these antiedges that deﬁne the architecture we seek. This is a surprisingly dense network, in which all 
but 3 of the 15 reciprocal connections appear to be necessary to explain observed responses. This dense connectivity may reﬂect the fact 
that, in this example, we deliberately chose regions that play an integrative (associational) role in cortical processing (c.f., hubs in 
graph theory; Bullmore and Sporns, 2009).

Figure 10 shows the underlying graph in anatomical and functional (spectral embedding) space. Note that these plots refer to undirected 
graphs (we will look at directed connection strengths below). The upper panel shows how the six regions are connected using the conditional 
means of the coupling parameters (in Fig. 9), under the selected (optimal) model. Arrow colors report the source of the strongest 
bidirectional connection, while arrow width represents absolute (positive or negative) strength. This provides a description of the network 
in anatomical space. A more functionally intuitive depiction of this graph is provided in the lower panel. Here, we have used spectral 
embedding to place the nodes in a functional space where the distance between them reﬂects the strength of bidirectional coupling (this is 
similar to

multidimensional scaling, but uses the graph Laplacian based on the weighted adjacency matrix to deﬁne similarities). We conclude by 
revisiting the issue of forward and backward connections, but here using effective connectivity based on fMRI.

Asymmetric connections and hierarchies. Network analyses using functional connectivity (correlations among observed neuronal time series) 
or diffusion-weighted MRI data cannot ask whether a connection is larger in one direction relative to another because they are restricted 
to the analysis of undirected (simple) graphs. However, here we have the unique opportunity to exploit asymmetries in reciprocal 
connections and revisit questions about hierarchical organization (e.g., Capalbo et al., 2008; Hilgetag et al., 2000; Lee and Mumford, 
2003; Reid et al., 2009). There are several strands of empirical and theoretical evidence to suggest that in comparison to bottom-up 
inﬂuences the net effects of top-down connections on their targets are inhibitory (e.g., by recruitment of local lateral connections; 
c.f., Angelucci et al., 2003; Crick and Koch, 1998). Theoretically, this is consistent with predictive coding, where top-down predictions 
suppress prediction errors in lower levels of a hierarchy (see above). One might, therefore, ask which hierarchical ordering of the nodes 
maximizes the average strength of forward connections relative to their backward homologue. This can be addressed by ﬁnding the order of 
nodes that maximizes the difference between the average forward and back-

ward estimates of effective connectivity. The resulting order was vis, sts, pfc, ppc, ag, and fef (see Fig. 10), which is not dissimilar to 
the vertical deployment of the nodes in functional embedding space (lower panel). The middle panel of Figure 10 shows the asymmetry indices 
for each connection based on the conditional estimates of the selected model. This is a pleasing result because it places the visual cortex 
at the bottom of the hierarchy and the frontal eye ﬁelds at the top, which we would expect from their functional anatomy. Note that there 
was no bias in the model or its speciﬁcation toward this result. Further, we did not use any experimental factors in specifying the model, 
and yet the data tell us that a plausible hierarchy is the best explanation for observed ﬂuctuations in brain activity (c.f., Mu¨llerLinow 
et al., 2008).

Summary

In summary, DCM calls on biophysical models of neuronal dynamics by treating them as generative models for empirical time series. The 
ensuing inferences pertain to the models per se and their parameters (e.g., effective connectivity) that generate observed responses. Using 
model comparison, one can search over wide model-spaces to ﬁnd optimal architectures or networks. Having selected the best model (or 
subset of models), one then has access to the posterior density on the neuronal and coupling parameters deﬁning the network. Of key 
interest here are changes in coupling that are induced

experimentally with, for example, drugs, attentional set, or time. These experimentally induced changes enable one to characterize the 
context-sensitive reconﬁguration of brain networks and test hypotheses about the relative inﬂuence of different connections. Recent 
advances in causal modeling based on random differential equations (Friston et al., 2008) can now accommodate hidden ﬂuctuations in 
neuronal states that enable the modeling of autonomous or endogenous brain dynamics. Coupled with advances in post hoc model selection, we 
can now search over vast model-spaces to discover the most likely networks generating both evoked and spontaneous activity. Clearly, there 
are still many unresolved issues in DCM.

In a discovery context, the speciﬁcation of the model space is a key issue. In other words, how many and which nodes do we consider? In 
general, prior beliefs about plausible and implausible architectures determine that space. Usually, these beliefs are implicit in the 
models considered, which are

usually assumed to be a priori equally likely. It should be noted that the posterior probability of a model depends not just on its 
evidence but on its prior probability. This can be speciﬁed quantitatively to moderate the evidence for unlikely models. At present, most 
DCM considers a rather limited number of nodes or sources (usually up to about eight). A future challenge will be to scale up the size of 
the networks considered and possibly consider coupling not between regions but between distributed patterns or modes (e.g., Daunizeau et 
al., 2009).

Conclusion

This review has used a series of (nested) dichotomies to help organize thinking about connectivity in the brain. It started with the 
distinction between functional segregation and integration. Within functional integration, we considered the key distinction between 
functional and effective connectivity and their relationship to underlying models of distributed processing. Within effective connectivity, 
we have looked at structural and dynamic causal modeling, while ﬁnally highlighting the distinction between DCM of evoked (induced) 
responses and autonomous (endogenous) activity.

Clearly, in stepping through these dichotomies, this review has taken a particular path—from functional integration to network discovery 
with DCM. This has necessarily precluded a proper treatment of many exciting developments in brain connectivity, particularly the use of 
functional connectivity in resting-state studies to compare cohorts or psychopharmacological manipulations (e.g., Pawela et al., 2008). I 
am also aware of omitting a full treatment of structurefunction relationships in the brain and the potential role of tractography and other 
approaches to anatomical connectivity. I apologize for this; I have focused on the issues that I

am familiar with and believe hold the key to a mechanistic application of connectivity analyses in systems neuroscience. I also apologize 
if you have been pursuing Granger causality or the comparison of correlations with gay abandon. I have been deliberately contrived in 
framing some of the conceptual issues to provoke a discussion. I may be wrong about these issues, although I do not usually make mistakes. 
Having said this, I did make a naive mistake in my ﬁrst article on functional connectivity (Friston et al., 1993), which no one has 
subsequently pointed out (perhaps out of kindness). A substantial part of Friston et al. (1993) was devoted to the problem of identifying 
the eigenvectors of very large (voxel · voxel) matrices, using a recursive (self-calling) algorithm. This was misguided and completely 
redundant because these eigenvectors can be accessed easily using singular value decomposition of the original (voxel · time) data matrix. 
I am grateful to Fred Brookstein for pointing this out after seeing me present the original idea. I tell this story to remind myself that 
every journey of discovery has to begin somewhere, and there is so much to learn (individually and collectively). Given the trends in 
publications on brain connectivity (Fig. 1), one might guess that we have now embarked on a journey; a journey that I am sure is taking us 
in the right direction. I would like to conclude by thanking the editors of Brain Connectivity (Chris and Bharat) for asking me to write 
this review and helping shape its content. On behalf of their readers, I also wish them every success in their editorial undertaking over 
the years to come.
