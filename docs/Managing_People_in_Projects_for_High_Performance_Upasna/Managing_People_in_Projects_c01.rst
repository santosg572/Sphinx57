Preface
=======

Evidence-based research in project management has shown that soft or people management skills contribute signiﬁcantly to a 
successful project and project success. However, most project management books treat people as a part of the overall project 
management knowledge, paying insufﬁcient attention to people management skills. Given that project organizations are made up of 
people and teams drawn from outside and inside the parent organizations, we feel that people management skills require special 
attention to build cohesive high-performance teams. Projects also require skills and effort from multiple disciplines and at 
multiple levels to develop project deliverables. Therefore, this book is structured to cover people skills and competencies from a 
micro-, meso-, and macro-lens.

La investigación basada en la evidencia en gestión de proyectos ha demostrado que las habilidades interpersonales o de gestión de personal contribuyen significativamente 
al éxito de un proyecto. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los libros sobre gestión de proyectos tratan a las personas como parte del conocimiento general de la gestión de 
proyectos, prestando poca atención a las habilidades de gestión de personal. Dado que las organizaciones de proyectos se componen de personas y equipos provenientes tanto 
de dentro como de fuera de las organizaciones matrices, consideramos que las habilidades de gestión de personal requieren especial atención para construir equipos 
cohesionados de alto rendimiento. Los proyectos también requieren habilidades y esfuerzo de múltiples disciplinas y a múltiples niveles para desarrollar los entregables 
del proyecto. Por lo tanto, este libro está estructurado para abordar las habilidades y competencias interpersonales desde una perspectiva micro, meso y macro.


Project managers play an important role in executing the project, and they are likely to perform well if their personal 
characteristics meet the requirements of the roles in a project. Knowing oneself, becoming aware of one’s values and personality as 
well as skills is a sure way of enhancing project performance. Therefore, at the micro-level, this book examines a range of personal 
project management competencies needed for managing oneself and others such as personality style, cognitive skills, and emotional 
intelligence in a project environment. The microsections of the book will also include useful discussions on available tools for 
managing the emotions of self and others effectively. This part of the book is written by Profs. Upasna A. Agarwal and Karuna Jain.

Los gerentes de proyecto desempeñan un papel importante en la ejecución del proyecto y es probable que tengan un buen desempeño si sus características personales cumplen 
con los requisitos de los roles en el proyecto. Conocerse a uno mismo, ser consciente de los propios valores, personalidad y habilidades, es una forma segura de mejorar 
el rendimiento del proyecto. Por lo tanto, a nivel micro, este libro examina diversas competencias personales de gestión de proyectos necesarias para la autogestión y la 
gestión de los demás, como el estilo de personalidad, las habilidades cognitivas y la inteligencia emocional en un entorno de proyecto. Las microsecciones del libro 
también incluirán análisis útiles sobre las herramientas disponibles para gestionar eficazmente las emociones propias y ajenas. Esta parte del libro está escrita por los 
profesores Upasna A. Agarwal y Karuna Jain.


Projects are executed in teams, as project tasks require expertise, skills, knowledge, judgement, and experience in multiple 
disciplines. At the meso-level, the book discusses basic team structure and managing a variety of teams used in projects such as 
virtual teams, project teams, and domain-speciﬁc teams. These skills will help to enhance productivity and manage the 
accountability of a project. The book also discusses processes, techniques, and tools to manage and enhance the performance of 
project teams; team process which include structure, culture, supporting systems, performance, and incentive systems that can impact 
team productivity. In addition, to the soft skills recommended by project management bodies of knowledge, we also plan to include 
the people management issues related to multigenerational teams (which are challenges that project managers face these days). This 
part of the book is written by Prof. Vittal Anantatmula.

Los proyectos se ejecutan en equipos, ya que las tareas del proyecto requieren experiencia, habilidades, conocimiento, juicio y experiencia en múltiples disciplinas. A 
nivel meso, el libro analiza la estructura básica del equipo y la gestión de una variedad de equipos utilizados en proyectos, como equipos virtuales, equipos de proyecto 
y equipos específicos del dominio. Estas habilidades ayudarán a mejorar la productividad y a gestionar la rendición de cuentas de un proyecto. El libro también analiza 
procesos, técnicas y herramientas para gestionar y mejorar el rendimiento de los equipos de proyecto; proceso de equipo que incluye estructura, cultura, sistemas de 
soporte, rendimiento y sistemas de incentivos que pueden afectar la productividad del equipo. Además de las habilidades blandas recomendadas por los organismos de 
conocimiento de gestión de proyectos, también planeamos incluir los problemas de gestión de personas relacionados con los equipos multigeneracionales (que son desafíos 
que enfrentan los gerentes de proyectos en estos días). Esta parte del libro está escrita por el Prof. Vittal Anantatmula.

 Finally, at the macro-level, the book will 
cover organizational and cultural aspects of a project 
manager’s work including the role of organizational cultures in a project context; alignment between project structure and culture; emerging leadership styles in 
projects, maintaining effective relationships with internal and external stakeholders; role of power, politics, and inﬂuence in 
relationship-building (social networks and social capital), and handing conﬂicts and negotiations. The book will also discuss 
ethical considerations in projects; relationship between projects and sustainability; societal responsibilities of projects; and 
building forms of control in projects (behaviour and outcome control).

Finalmente, a nivel macro, el libro abordará los aspectos organizativos y culturales del trabajo de un director de proyectos, incluyendo el rol de las culturas 
organizacionales en el contexto de un proyecto; la alineación entre la estructura y la cultura del proyecto; los estilos de liderazgo emergentes en los proyectos, el 
mantenimiento de relaciones efectivas con las partes interesadas internas y externas; el rol del poder, la política y la influencia en la construcción de relaciones 
(redes sociales y capital social), y la gestión de conflictos y negociaciones. El libro también abordará las consideraciones éticas en los proyectos; la relación entre 
los proyectos y la sostenibilidad; las responsabilidades sociales de los proyectos; y el desarrollo de formas de control en los proyectos (control del comportamiento y de 
los resultados).

 This book is very useful for project management professionals and project managers in any 
organization and will also be a resource for academic institutions in teaching project management. The book is primarily positioned for practitioners. However, it is an 
equally important source for master’s students studying project management (part-time or a full-degree course), as a textbook or a 
reference material. This part of the book is written by Prof. Shankar Sankaran.


Este libro es muy útil para profesionales y gerentes de proyectos de cualquier organización, y también será un recurso para instituciones académicas en la enseñanza de la 
gestión de proyectos. Está dirigido principalmente a profesionales. Sin embargo, es una fuente igualmente importante para estudiantes de maestría en gestión de proyectos 
(a tiempo parcial o completo), como libro de texto o material de referencia. Esta parte del libro está escrita por el profesor Shankar Sankaran.

Praise for Managing  People in Projects for High Performance 
-----------------------------------------------------------

“Managing People in Projects for High Performance covers and integrates the wide variety of leadership and behavioral perspectives 
in and around projects. A comprehensive range of topics is addressed, from project manager personal characteristics via team and 
organizational leadership to that of projects, their leadership and ethics. Written by renown authors, the book provides a timely 
oversight of emerging new leadership perspectives, as well as existing theoretical frameworks. To that end, it is a highly 
recommended single source of information for all those looking for a broad, in-depth, and up-to-date overview of the contemporary 
understanding of leadership.”

Gestión de Personas en Proyectos para un Alto Rendimiento abarca e integra la amplia variedad de perspectivas de liderazgo y comportamiento en los proyectos y sus 
alrededores. Aborda una amplia gama de temas, desde las características personales del gerente de proyectos, pasando por el liderazgo de equipos y organizacional, hasta 
el liderazgo y la ética de los proyectos. Escrito por autores de renombre, el libro ofrece una visión general de las nuevas perspectivas de liderazgo emergentes, así como 
de los marcos teóricos existentes. Por ello, es una fuente de información muy recomendable para quienes buscan una visión general amplia, profunda y actualizada de la 
comprensión contemporánea del liderazgo.


—Dr. Ralf Müller, Professor of Project Management, BI Norwegian Business School

“This book on Managing People in Projects for High Performance is not simply welcome, it is a needed contribution to the ﬁeld of 
project management. Effective self-management is important on projects, where people so often feel insufﬁcient support is provided 
by the ﬁrms delivering the projects. Teams need management, not only the relationships between the members, but for engagement with 
other teams, supply chains and clients. It is the other internal teams which introduces organizational management.

Este libro sobre la Gestión de Personas en Proyectos para un Alto Rendimiento no es simplemente bienvenido, sino una contribución necesaria al campo de la gestión de 
proyectos. La autogestión eficaz es importante en los proyectos, donde las personas a menudo sienten que las empresas que los ejecutan no les brindan el apoyo suficiente. 
Los equipos necesitan gestión, no solo en las relaciones entre sus miembros, sino también para la interacción con otros equipos, las cadenas de suministro y los clientes. 
Son los demás equipos internos los que introducen la gestión organizacional.

 A refreshing feature is the hybrid between sole authorship and an edited collection. 
The authors have written different sections, hence bringing different knowledge and skill sets to this well-rounded consideration of people and soft skills in project 
management.”

—Emeritus Professor Hedley Smyth, The Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction, UCL, London

“Building high-performing team, guiding and helping the team successfully complete the project at hand, is core of project business. 
I am excited to see this splendid scholarly work done by Upasana, Karuna, Vittal and Shankar, address this very issue. I am privy to 
their prowess and intellectual capability to address project management topics, through my association with them through our 
institute and PMI, but this work stands out. ‘Managing self, teams and the business’, is contextually more relevant to the current 
era where technology is largely taking care of process and tools part of project execution and the project leaders need to focus on 
the areas that machines currently cannot handle—the emotional connect, conﬂicts, ethical dilemmas and inspiration for superior 
performance. I recommend this compendium on project management soft skills for both academia and practitioners at large.”

**Uma’s Story**

Uma was a stellar performer in her job of a project analyst and was recently promoted 
as project head. One of her tasks as a project manager was to lead meetings and manage performances. With a hybrid work structure, most team members connected on the 
phone from three or four different locations. These team meetings were anything but structured. Everyone had a point of view which they wanted to voice. Meetings were a 
cacophony and Uma found it very difﬁcult to ask people to stop speaking. When she tried controlling, she was talked over, there were side conversations. She felt out of 
control, and it was exhausting to keep the team focused on the task. At the end of the day, not much was achieved. Radha felt helpless and met some friends over the 
weekend and get their thoughts of managing better her performance. She was recommended to read How to Make Friends and Inﬂuence People or attend a Dale Carnegie workshop 
and watch Amy Cuddy’s TED. Uma’s did all she was recommended but in vain and was still uncomfortable as her team performance showed no improvement. During her appraisal, 
she conﬁded in top leadership that she was ﬁnding it extremely difﬁcult to keep pace with expectations and she would like to consider a proﬁle change.

In your view, what was the issue?

1.1 Introduction

Project managers are accountable for achieving task goals despite the constraints associated with projects including time, scope, 
cost, quality, resources, and risk. To meet these demands, project managers must be able to effectively apply and integrate the 
processes. However, to be able to do effectively accomplish tasks and enhance performance, a person needs to primarily like the job 
and feel conﬁdent to be able to perform. One’s personality can play a signiﬁcant role in task performance. Personality could be 
understood as an individual’s unique ‘operating system’, giving them an idea of what comes naturally to them and what is that they 
would need to invest their time into. Among many things, congruence between one’s personality and task demands have been found to 
make a different to performance.

1.2 Personality and Performance

Personalities are characterized in terms of traits, which are relatively enduring characteristics that inﬂuence our behaviour 
across many situations.

An obvious question is—how can personality impact human productivity and performance of a project manager?

There is an old maxim— When love and skill combine, expect a masterpiece. When we perform activities that come naturally to us, we 
experience a state of comfort and ﬂow. On the other hand, when we push ourselves to do jobs that we are not naturally inclined to, 
e experience fatigue and exhaustion.

Knowledge of one’s personality can explain to a large extent occupation as well as roles and responsibilities in which they will 
thrive and be productive. It is also indicative of situations that an individual would need to put in additional mindful efforts 
into. While a congruence between personality characteristics and job characteristics enhances satisfaction and engagement, lack of 
it can result into stress and burnout.

The situation Uma was in, reﬂects the case. Misalignment between roles expectations and personality traits drains energy.

According to personality–job ﬁt theory, person’s personality traits will signal the adaptability with a job.

1.3 Big Five: Personality Factors

Although there are many frameworks to understand personality, the most widely accepted model of personality is the ‘Big Five’, which 
examines personalities into ﬁve types: open, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Big Five is also 
called the openness to experience (O), conscientiousness (C), extraversion (E), agreeableness (A), and emotional stability (N). 
OCEAN proﬁle. In the following paragraphs, we discuss the OCEAN dimensions and its characteristics.

**Extraversion**

Let me begin by asking you a few questions: How do you prefer spending time—with self or others? When with people, do you prefer 
spending time knowing them or do you prefer spending with yourself? Are you happy seeing a lot of people or do you shy away?

The extraversion dimension captures the extent to which we are comfortable with people. Extraverts draw their energy from people 
around them. They are social and gregarious, unlike introverts who are quiet, reserved, and shy. Individuals who demonstrate a mix 
of extrovert and introvert features are called ambivert.

How does personality impact productivity.

Imagine the impact if an introvert were a part of a project that demands frequent interaction? What would an extrovert experience if 
(s)he was put into a job which needs no or least interpersonal interaction?

In positions that require the manager to be outgoing and connect and engage subordinates, someone who is an extrovert and is 
comfortable in connecting with people will thrive. In fact, extroverts are considered as a leadership proﬁle, one needs to be 
comfortable in engagement with others.

However, research by Corrinne Bendersky of University of California, Los Angeles, and Neha Parikh Shah of Rutgers University 
provides a surprising ﬁnding suggesting that in contrast to expectation, extrovert managers become less appreciated of group 
members contributions and tend to accrue all achievements to themselves. This may not be a desirable trait of a project managers.

Thus, with experience working together, however, both types of people, extroverts and introverts, may be important and valued 
contributors to their teams and thus teams initially overvalue extraverts, but they often end up disappointed and the status of 
extraverts tends to fall over time.

Agreeableness. Agreeable people keep team harmony, are trusting and cooperative. They are ﬂexible and easy to get along. On the 
other hand, those who are low on agreeableness come across as fault-ﬁnding, critical, risk-averse, argumentative and can be seen as 
unkind.

When managing teams of large diverse people, which kind of personality will do well? If there were safety decisions to be taken with 
regard to manufacturing on anti-ballistic missiles, which of the two personalities would make effective decision?

Who is more effective as a project team Manager?

Well, managers who are more agreeable may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to make independent unpopular decisions and play to the gallery. On the 
other hand, those who have high degree of disagreeableness may be nit-picking every issue. The way forward is balance. To those who are too agreeable, effort would need 
to be made to identify gaps and possible loopholes in the project. If 
someone is disagreeable, balance criticism with empathy.

• Conscientiousness. Highly conscientiousness people are very organized and undertake their tasks diligently. They come across as 
perfectionist and will know all ‘I’ to dot and ‘T’ to cross. They manage their energy well and have a high say-do ratio. When given 
a task, they will execute to the best of their abilities. Individuals low on conscientiousness are spontaneous, easy-going and come 
across as unreliable.

Who is more effective as a project team Manager?

One of the projects is time and mission critical and needs you to do regular planning and follow-up. The second project is not time 
critical and but needs out of the box thinking.

• Openness to experience. Attentiveness, imaginative, and sensitivity to stimulus characterize people who are open to experience. 
They are willing to let go their comfort and embrace uncertainty. They undertake risks, are curious, and thrive in unfamiliar 
situations. One the other hand, people with low levels of openness to experience are conventional, conservative, risk-averse, and 
ﬁnd comfort in the familiar situations.

• Emotional stability. People high on emotional stability remain balanced and withstand stress. Those with low emotional stability 
experience high negative emotions, are anxious, and are insecure. They often remain tense, anxious, nervous. They are referred to as 
Type A personality and have usually been seen to be very goal-oriented and practical in their solutions. On the other hand, people 
high on emotional stability feel poised, conﬁdent under pressure. Studies suggest those high on neuroticism do well in high 
pressure, quick goal professions such as bankers, defence forces, revenue collectors, security personnel, among others.

In terms of the effectiveness, no single trait is effective. It depends on the context and the ability to get the job done. In 
certain situations (emergency), neuroticism may be an effective personality. Further, life stages, experiences, education, among 
others, can also bring changes in personality. In fact, working with someone for a long period or working in a type of organization 
can impact our personality.

**Key Skills for Project Managers**

**Control Orientation-Locus of Control**

Once upon a time, a shoe company sent two salesmen to western interiors of India to determine the market potential for their 
products. Both the salesmen completed a market scan and called back to the ofﬁce. One of the salesmen reported: ‘No one here wears 
any shoes, there is no market for us here!’. The other salesman sent a message ‘No one here wears any shoes, there is a huge market 
for us, send inventory fast!’.

Same situation, nut diametrically opposite responses—how do we explain this? This is popularly referred to as ‘a matter of 
attitude’. How we react to a situation has not only to do with the situation itself, but also with how we recognize, think, and feel 
about the situation. Individuals can be identiﬁed to have two approaches to situations: Individuals who believe that they control 
their fate and have the power to change the course of life are referred to as those with master of destiny attitude or internals and 
those who believe that their life is controlled by factors beyond their control are called externals or those with victims of fate 
attitude. People who have external LOC believe that everything happening in their life can be attributed to situations outside their 
control and they are pawns or even as victims of situations. On the other hand, people with internal LOC believe they write their 
own scripts, that their own actions determine their success or failure. They think long term, manage adversity, and show initiative.

Rotter (1966), who invented the term locus of control found that those with an internal locus of control, have high need for 
achievement demonstrate grit and have higher adversity quotient.

Studies on locus of control of project manager by Loosemore and Lam (2004) show that those who have a predisposition to behave in a 
certain way towards projects can go a long way in impacting success or failure. Projects experience unexpected challenges. A project 
manager with strong external LOC could seriously impede the execution of a project or could get in the way during team management 
activities. On the other hand, a PM with high internal LOC will manage the same adversity with grit and perseverance.

Can locus of control be enhanced? Studies suggest that regular reﬂections and micro-habits can improve one’s attitude.

Who are you? Master of Destiny or Victim of Fate Proﬁle? 2

**Key Skills for Project Management**

**Tolerance to Ambiguity**

Ambiguity and uncertainty are an intrinsic part of any project and any performance measure such as time, budget, scope, and quality 
may undergo a change impacting on the project outcomes and objectives. Project manager not only needs to be comfortable with changing the unexpected but also quick 
in making decisions and accept uncertainty.

A project manager has to take charge of the situation and step-in to address the issues as is the need of the hour, sometimes. In 
times, (s)he needs to be a troubleshooter, expeditor, consolidator, orchestrator, networker, ambassador, entrepreneur, and knowledge 
giver. In a study by Hogan and Park on 123 team leaders in the six-sigma context, it was found that ambiguity acceptance was very 
critical to obtain success in complex projects.

Ambiguity acceptance or ambiguity tolerance is considered a key skill of any project manager. It refers to ‘the tendency to perceive 
ambiguous situations as desirable’ (Budner, 1962, p. 29) and ‘an individual’s willingness to accommodate or adapt to encounters with 
ambiguous situations or ideas’ (p. 338). Individuals with higher ambiguity acceptance are risk taking and have high ability to work 
on complex tasks.

What is your comfort with ambiguity and Uncertainty?

Can ambiguity and uncertainty tolerance be increased?

Studies suggest that individuals with high adaptivity and inculcating a growth mindset, one’s tolerance to ambiguity can be changed. 
Adaptability is considered as a meta-skill—learning how to learn and being conscious of when to put that learner’s mind into action. 
Adaptability can be nurtured by taking small steps to do things differently

1.4 Risk Taking Potential

As discussed, project managers have to be comfortable with thriving in ambiguity and making decisions. Every decision taken by a 
project manager will have a consequence. A project manager needs to have high ability to take risks and should be willingness to 
take risk, is deﬁned as an individual’s ‘current tendency towards taking or avoiding risks’ (Sitkin & Pablo, 1992, p. 124). It can 
be expressed as the decision-makers’ risk seeking or risk aversion attitudes.

While taking risks ﬁnally depends on the context, individuals differ in their propensity and some are high risk takers, while some 
others are averse. In a study done by Wang et al. 2016, the personality of project managers inﬂuences their risk propensity. 
Extraverts, look out for stimulating, new, varied, and complex situations and are comfortable in taking social risks. On the other 
hand, introverts avoid taking risks. Similarly, conscientious people are self-control and discipline and tend to work in structured 
well-regulated environment. Thus, they are less willing to take risks (Hogan & Ones, 1997). Agreeable people always put people
and systems expectations before their own needs and are discouraged in engage in risk taking. Thus, high on agreeableness will be 
discouraged to engage in risk taking. Further, aptitude to undertake risk varies as a function of contexts (Keil et al., 2000; 
MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1990; Weber et al., 2002).

What is your risk appetite?

Can risk propensity be increased?

Risk appetite can be increased. For instance, a recent McKinsey article ‘Have you made it safe to Fail’, suggested that a culture of 
‘celebrating mistakes’ can motivate us to take mindful risks.

1.5 Managing Stress and Time

A project, by deﬁnition, has an ofﬁcial end date. Despite planning well, a project manager often faces unforeseen roadblocks such 
as issues inadequate resources allocation to the project, unrealistic deadlines, unclear goals, lack of team members’ motivation, 
insufﬁcient planning, ineffective communication or goal shift or resource availability. Project manager (PM) job is considered to 
be one of the most stressful jobs. According to a 2012 study by Samad Aidane, project managers are more prone to work-related stress 
in comparison to other ofﬁce professions.

Since the project manager is directly responsible and accountable for the success or failure of a project, (s)he has to be adept at 
managing timelines. Time is money, goes the old adage. For every minute spent organizing, an hour is earned, said Benjamin Franklin. 
For the PM to manage project schedule, time management is so critical. Without it, projects don’t get done on time and may not get 
done at all.

One of the often-used tools to plan activities is the Eisenhower Matrix. It was designed by former US President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, who played several roles while holding the position of a president. His days used to be busy, and he had to decide which 
tasks he should concentrate on, on a daily basis. He used this matrix to examine the important tasks. The Eisenhower Matrix, also 
referred to as the Urgent-Important Matrix, helps to sort tasks by their urgency and importance. According to this matrix, there is 
a difference between important and urgent. This tool helps to prioritize time by helping in identifying tasks that are truly urgent 
issues, at the same time as you work towards important, longer-term goals.

Besides the Eisenhower Matrix, productive people engage in some rituals everyday:

1. Making use of technology: Setting up regular e-mail alerts or use apps (Evernote) to organise information needed can save a lot 
of time.

2. Making to-do list: Each week before work, make a to-do list of high priority work that must be accomplished.

3. At the end of every day, list the high priority work that needs to get done the next day.

4. Avoiding procrastination: Using deadlines can be an effective way of managing work. ‘Eating a frog’, that is getting done with 
tasks that are not necessarily motivating can be addressed early in the day.

5. Rejuvenating: Block out time on your calendar during the time of day to tale walks and engage in rejuvenation.

Self-assessment: How are your time management skills?

1.6 Summary

The chapter introduced how self-awareness and knowing one’s values and personality can impact project performance. The chapter also 
discusses important personality types such as Big Five and Type A and B frameworks. Range of personal project management skills, 
viz. control orientation-accountability-locus of control, resilience, risk taking, managing ambiguity, and managing time were also 
discussed.
