2.01 Identify that if all parts of an object move in the same direction and at the same rate, we can treat the object as if it
were a (point-like) particle. (This chapter is about the motion of such objects.)

2.02 Identify that the position of a particle is its location as read on a scaled axis, such as an x axis.

the motion.

2.06 Given a graph of a particle’s position versus time, determine the average velocity between any two particular
times


Key Ideas

* The position x of a particle on an x axis locates the particle with respect to the origin, or zero point, of the axis.
* The position is either positive or negative, according to which side of the origin the particle is on, or zero if
the particle is at the origin. The positive direction on an axis is the direction of increasing positive numbers;
the opposite direction is the negative direction on
the axis.
* The displacement :math:`\Delta x` of a particle is the change in its position:

.. math::

   \Delta x = x_2 - x_1.

* Displacement is a vector quantity. It is positive if the particle has moved in the positive direction of the x axis
and negative if the particle has moved in the negative direction.

* When a particle has moved from position x1 to position x2
during a time interval :math:`\delta t_2 - t_1`, its average velocity during
that interval is

.. math::

   v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2-x_1}{t_2-t_1}

* The algebraic sign of vavg indicates the direction of motion
(:math:`v_{avg}` is a vector quantity). Average velocity does not depend
on the actual distance a particle moves, but instead depends
on its original and final positions.

* On a graph of x versus t, the average velocity for a time in-
terval :math:`\Delta t` is the slope of the straight line connecting the points
on the curve that represent the two ends of the interval.

* The average speed :math:`s_{avg}` of a particle during a time interval :math:`\Delta t`
depends on the total distance the particle moves in that time
interval:

.. math::

   s_{avg} = \frac{total distance}{\Delta t}


What Is Physics?
----------------

One purpose of physics is to study the motion of objects—how fast they move, for
example, and how far they move in a given amount of time. NASCAR engineers
are fanatical about this aspect of physics as they determine the performance of
their cars before and during a race. Geologists use this physics to measure
tectonic-plate motion as they attempt to predict earthquakes. Medical
researchers need this physics to map the blood flow through a patient when
diagnosing a partially closed artery, and motorists use it to determine how they
might slow sufficiently when their radar detector sounds a warning. There are
countless other examples. In this chapter, we study the basic physics of motion
where the object (race car, tectonic plate, blood cell, or any other object) moves
along a single axis. Such motion is called one-dimensional motion.

Motion
------

The world, and everything in it, moves. Even seemingly stationary things, such as a
roadway, move with Earth’s rotation, Earth’s orbit around the Sun, the Sun’s orbit
around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and that galaxy’s migration relative to
other galaxies. The classification and comparison of motions (called kinematics) is
often challenging.What exactly do you measure, and how do you compare?

Before we attempt an answer, we shall examine some general properties of
motion that is restricted in three ways.

1. The motion is along a straight line only. The line may be vertical, horizontal, or
slanted, but it must be straight.

2. Forces (pushes and pulls) cause motion but will not be discussed until
Chapter 5. In this chapter we discuss only the motion itself and changes in the
motion. Does the moving object speed up, slow down, stop, or reverse
direction? If the motion does change, how is time involved in the change?

3. The moving object is either a particle (by which we mean a point-like object
such as an electron) or an object that moves like a particle (such that every
portion moves in the same direction and at the same rate). A stiff pig slipping
down a straight playground slide might be considered to be moving like a par-
ticle; however, a tumbling tumbleweed would not.

Position and Displacement

To locate an object means to find its position relative to some reference point, of-
ten the origin (or zero point) of an axis such as the x axis in Fig. 2-1. The positive
direction of the axis is in the direction of increasing numbers (coordinates), which
is to the right in Fig. 2-1. The opposite is the negative direction.

For example, a particle might be located at x = 5 m, which means it is 5 m in
the positive direction from the origin. If it were at x = -5 m, it would be just as
far from the origin but in the opposite direction. On the axis, a coordinate of
$5 m is less than a coordinate of -1 m, and both coordinates are less than a
coordinate of +5 m. A plus sign for a coordinate need not be shown, but a minus
sign must always be shown.

A change from position x1 to position x2 is called a displacement -x, where

.. math::

   \Delta x = x_2 - x_1.

(2-1)

(The symbol :math:`\Delta`, the Greek uppercase delta, represents a change in a quantity,
and it means the final value of that quantity minus the initial value.) When
numbers are inserted for the position values x1 and x2 in Eq. 2-1, a displacement
in the positive direction (to the right in Fig. 2-1) always comes out positive, and
a displacement in the opposite direction (left in the figure) always comes out
negative. For example, if the particle moves from x1 " 5 m to x2 " 12 m, then
the displacement is :math:`\Delta x = (12 m) - (5 m) = +7 m`. The positive result indicates
that the motion is in the positive direction. If, instead, the particle moves from
x1 " 5 m to x2 " 1 m, then :math:`\Delta x =  (1 m) - (5 m) = -4 m`. The negative result in-
dicates that the motion is in the negative direction.

The actual number of meters covered for a trip is irrelevant; displacement in-
volves only the original and final positions. For example, if the particle moves
from x = 5 m out to x = 200 m and then back to x = 5 m, the displacement from
start to finish is :math:`\Delta x = (5 m) - (5 m) = 0`.

**Signs.** A plus sign for a displacement need not be shown, but a minus sign
must always be shown. If we ignore the sign (and thus the direction) of a displace-
ment, we are left with the magnitude (or absolute value) of the displacement. For
example, a displacement of :math:`\Delta x = -4 m` has a magnitude of 4 m.

Displacement is an example of a vector quantity, which is a quantity that has
both a direction and a magnitude. We explore vectors more fully in Chapter 3, but
here all we need is the idea that displacement has two features: (1) Its magnitude
is the distance (such as the number of meters) between the original and final po-
sitions. (2) Its direction, from an original position to a final position, can be repre-
sented by a plus sign or a minus sign if the motion is along a single axis.

Here is the first of many checkpoints where you can check your understanding
with a bit of reasoning. The answers are in the back of the book.

Checkpoint 1

Here are three pairs of initial and final positions, respectively, along an x axis. Which
pairs give a negative displacement: (a) -3 m, +5 m; (b) -3 m, -7 m; (c) 7 m, -3 m?

Average Velocity and Average Speed
----------------------------------

A compact way to describe position is with a graph of position x plotted as a func-
tion of time t—a graph of x(t). (The notation x(t) represents a function x of t, not
the product x times t.) As a simple example, Fig. 2-2 shows the position function
x(t) for a stationary armadillo (which we treat as a particle) over a 7 s time inter-
val. The animal’s position stays at x = -2 m.

Figure 2-3 is more interesting, because it involves motion. The armadillo is
apparently first noticed at t = 0 when it is at the position x=-5 m. It moves
toward x = 0, passes through that point at t = 3 s, and then moves on to increasingly larger positive values of x. Figure 2-3 also depicts the straight-line motion of
the armadillo (at three times) and is something like what you would see. The
graph in Fig. 2-3 is more abstract, but it reveals how fast the armadillo moves.

Actually, several quantities are associated with the phrase “how fast.” One of
them is the average velocity :math:`v_{avg}`, which is the ratio of the displacement :math:`\Delta x` that
occurs during a particular time interval :math:`\Delta t` to that interval:

.. math::

   v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}

(2-2)

The notation means that the position is x1 at time t1 and then x2 at time t2. A com-
mon unit for vavg is the meter per second (m/s). You may see other units in the
problems, but they are always in the form of length/time.

**Graphs.** On a graph of x versus t, vavg is the slope of the straight line that
connects two particular points on the x(t) curve: one is the point that corresponds
to x2 and t2, and the other is the point that corresponds to x1 and t1. Like displace-
ment, vavg has both magnitude and direction (it is another vector quantity). Its
magnitude is the magnitude of the line’s slope. A positive vavg (and slope) tells us
that the line slants upward to the right; a negative vavg (and slope) tells us that the
line slants downward to the right. The average velocity vavg always has the same
sign as the displacement -x because -t in Eq. 2-2 is always positive.

Figure 2-4 shows how to find vavg in Fig. 2-3 for the time interval t " 1 s to t " 4 s.
We draw the straight line that connects the point on the position curve at the begin-
ning of the interval and the point on the curve at the end of the interval.Then we find
the slope :math:`\Delta x/\Delta t` of the straight line. For the given time interval, the average velocity is

.. math:

   v_{avg} = \frac{6m}{3s} = 2 m/s.


**Average speed** savg is a different way of describing “how fast” a particle
moves. Whereas the average velocity involves the particle’s displacement :math:`\Delta x`, the
average speed involves the total distance covered (for example, the number of
meters moved), independent of direction; that is,

.. math::

   s_{avg}  = \frac{total distance}{\Delta x}

Because average speed does not include direction, it lacks any algebraic sign.
Sometimes savg is the same (except for the absence of a sign) as vavg. However, the
two can be quite different.

Sample Problem 2.01 Average velocity, beat-up pickup truck

You drive a beat-up pickup truck along a straight road for
8.4 km at 70 km/h, at which point the truck runs out of gasoline and stops. Over the next 30 min, you walk another
2.0 km farther along the road to a gasoline station.

(a) What is your overall displacement from the beginning
of your drive to your arrival at the station?

KEY IDEA

Assume, for convenience, that you move in the positive di-
rection of an x axis, from a first position of x1 " 0 to a second
position of x2 at the station. That second position must be at
x2 = 8.4 km + 2.0 km = 10.4 km. Then your displacement -x
along the x axis is the second position minus the first position.

Calculation: From Eq. 2-1, we have

:math:`\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 10.4 km - 0 = 10.4 km`.
(Answer)

Thus, your overall displacement is 10.4 km in the positive
direction of the x axis.

(b) What is the time interval :math:`\Delta t` from the beginning of your
drive to your arrival at the station?

KEY IDEA

We already know the walking time interval :math:`\Delta t_{wlk}` (= 0.50 h),
but we lack the driving time interval :math:`\Delta t_{dr}`. However, we
know that for the drive the displacement :math:`\Delta x_{dr}` is 8.4 km and
the average velocity vavg,dr is 70 km/h. Thus, this average
velocity is the ratio of the displacement for the drive to the
time interval for the drive.

Calculations: We first write

.. math::

   v_{avg,dr} = \frac{\Delta x_{dr}}{\Delta t_{dr}}

Rearranging and substituting data then give us

.. math::

   \Delta t_{dr} = \frac{\Delta x_{dr}}{v_{avg,_dr}} = \frac{8.4 km}{70 km/h} = 0.12 h    

(Answer)

So, :math:`\Delta t = \Delta t_{dr} + \Delta t_{wlk}`

= 0.12 h + 0.50 h = 0.62 h.

(c) What is your average velocity vavg from the beginning of
your drive to your arrival at the station? Find it both numerically and graphically

KEY IDEA

From Eq. 2-2 we know that vavg for the entire trip is the ratio
of the displacement of 10.4 km for the entire trip to the time
interval of 0.62 h for the entire trip.

Calculation: Here we find

.. math::

   v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{10.4 km}{0.62 h}

To find vavg graphically, first we graph the function x(t) as
shown in Fig. 2-5, where the beginning and arrival points on
the graph are the origin and the point labeled as “Station.”Your
average velocity is the slope of the straight line connecting
those points; that is, vavg is the ratio of the rise (:math:`\Delta x = 10.4 km`)
to the run (:math:`\Delta t = 0.62 h`), which gives us vavg " 16.8 km/h.

(d) Suppose that to pump the gasoline, pay for it, and walk
back to the truck takes you another 45 min. What is your
average speed from the beginning of your drive to your
return to the truck with the gasoline?

KEY IDEA

Your average speed is the ratio of the total distance you
move to the total time interval you take to make that move.

Calculation: The total distance is 8.4 km + 2.0 km + 2.0
km = 12.4 km. The total time interval is 0.12 h + 0.50 h +
0.75 h = 1.37 h. Thus, Eq. 2-3 gives us

.. math::

   s_{avg} = \frac{12.4 km}{1.37 h} = 9.1 km/h

Figure 2-5 The lines marked “Driving” and “Walking” are the
position – time plots for the driving and walking stages. (The plot
for the walking stage assumes a constant rate of walking.) The
slope of the straight line joining the origin and the point labeled
“Station” is the average velocity for the trip, from the beginning
to the station.

2-2 INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED
------------------------------------

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .

2.07 Given a particle’s position as a function of time,
calculate the instantaneous velocity for any particular time.

2.08 Given a graph of a particle’s position versus time, deter-
mine the instantaneous velocity for any particular time.

2.09 Identify speed as the magnitude of the instantaneous
velocity.

Key Ideas

* The instantaneous velocity (or simply velocity) v of a moving
particle is

.. math::

   v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}


where :math:`\Delta x = x_2 - x_1` and :math:`\Delta t = t_2 - t_1`.

* The instantaneous velocity (at a particular time) may be
found as the slope (at that particular time) of the graph of x
versus t.

* Speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity.

Instantaneous Velocity and Speed
--------------------------------

You have now seen two ways to describe how fast something moves: average
velocity and average speed, both of which are measured over a time interval -t.
However, the phrase “how fast” more commonly refers to how fast a particle is
moving at a given instant—its instantaneous velocity (or simply velocity) v.

The velocity at any instant is obtained from the average velocity by shrinking
the time interval :math:`\Delta t` closer and closer to 0. As :math:`\Delta t` dwindles, the average velocity
approaches a limiting value, which is the velocity at that instant:

.. math::

   v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}

Note that v is the rate at which position x is changing with time at a given instant;
that is, v is the derivative of x with respect to t. Also note that v at any instant is
the slope of the position – time curve at the point representing that instant.
Velocity is another vector quantity and thus has an associated direction.

**Speed** is the magnitude of velocity; that is, speed is velocity that has been
stripped of any indication of direction, either in words or via an algebraic sign.
(Caution: Speed and average speed can be quite different.) A velocity of #5 m/s
and one of $5 m/s both have an associated speed of 5 m/s. The speedometer in a
car measures speed, not velocity (it cannot determine the direction).

Checkpoint 2

The following equations give the position x(t) of a particle in four situations (in each
equation, x is in meters, t is in seconds, and t > 0): (1) x = 3t - 2; (2) :math:`x = 4t^2 - 2`;
(3) :math:`x = 2/t^2`; and (4) x = -2. (a) In which situation is the velocity v of the particle con-
stant? (b) In which is v in the negative x direction?

Sample Problem 2.02 Velocity and slope of x versus t, elevator cab

Figure 2-6a is an x(t) plot for an elevator cab that is initially
stationary, then moves upward (which we take to be the pos-
itive direction of x), and then stops. Plot v(t).

KEY IDEA

We can find the velocity at any time from the slope of the
x(t) curve at that time.

Calculations: The slope of x(t), and so also the velocity, is
zero in the intervals from 0 to 1 s and from 9 s on, so then
the cab is stationary. During the interval bc, the slope is con-
stant and nonzero, so then the cab moves with constant velocity. We calculate the slope of x(t) then as

.. math::

   \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = v = \frac{24 m  - 4-0 m}{8.0 s - 3.0 s} = + 4.0 m/s

(2-5)

The plus sign indicates that the cab is moving in the posi-
tive x direction. These intervals (where v " 0 and v "
4 m/s) are plotted in Fig. 2-6b. In addition, as the cab ini-
tially begins to move and then later slows to a stop,
v varies as indicated in the intervals 1 s to 3 s and 8 s to 9 s.
Thus, Fig. 2-6b is the required plot. (Figure 2-6c is consid-
ered in Module 2-3.)

Given a v(t) graph such as Fig. 2-6b, we could “work
backward” to produce the shape of the associated x(t) graph
(Fig. 2-6a). However, we would not know the actual values
for x at various times, because the v(t) graph indicates
only changes in x. To find such a change in x during any interval, we must, in the language of calculus, calculate the
area “under the curve” on the v(t) graph for that interval.
For example, during the interval 3 s to 8 s in which the cab
has a velocity of 4.0 m/s, the change in x is

.. math::

   \Delta x = (4.0 m/s)(8.0 s $ 3.0 s) = +20 m.

(2-6)

(This area is positive because the v(t) curve is above the
t axis.) Figure 2-6a shows that x does indeed increase by
20 m in that interval. However, Fig. 2-6b does not tell us the
values of x at the beginning and end of the interval. For that,
we need additional information, such as the value of x at
some instant.


2-3 ACCELERATION
-----------------

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .

2.10 Apply the relationship between a particle’s average
acceleration, its change in velocity, and the time interval
for that change.

2.11 Given a particle’s velocity as a function of time, calcu-
late the instantaneous acceleration for any particular time.

2.12 Given a graph of a particle’s velocity versus time, deter-
mine the instantaneous acceleration for any particular time
and the average acceleration between any two particular
times

Key Ideas

* Average acceleration is the ratio of a change in velocity :math:`\Delta v`
to the time interval :math:`\Delta t` in which the change occurs:

.. math::

   a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}

The algebraic sign indicates the direction of aavg.

* Instantaneous acceleration (or simply acceleration) a is the
first time derivative of velocity v(t) and the second time deriv-
ative of position x(t):

.. math::

   a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}

* On a graph of v versus t, the acceleration a at any time t is
the slope of the curve at the point that represents t.

Acceleration
------------

When a particle’s velocity changes, the particle is said to undergo acceleration (or
to accelerate). For motion along an axis, the average acceleration aavg over a time
interval :math:`\Delta t` is

.. math::

   a_{avg} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}

(2-7)

where the particle has velocity v1 at time t1 and then velocity v2 at time t2. The
instantaneous acceleration (or simply acceleration) is

.. math::

   a= \frac{dv}{dt}

(2-8)

In words, the acceleration of a particle at any instant is the rate at which its velocity
is changing at that instant. Graphically, the acceleration at any point is the slope of
the curve of v(t) at that point.We can combine Eq. 2-8 with Eq. 2-4 to write

.. math::

   a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (\frac{dx}{dt}) = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}

In words, the acceleration of a particle at any instant is the second derivative of
its position x(t) with respect to time.

A common unit of acceleration is the meter per second per second: :math:`m/(s \cdot s)`
or :math:`m/s^2`. Other units are in the form of length/(time ! time) or length/time2.
Acceleration has both magnitude and direction (it is yet another vector quan-
tity). Its algebraic sign represents its direction on an axis just as for displacement
and velocity; that is, acceleration with a positive value is in the positive direction
of an axis, and acceleration with a negative value is in the negative direction.

Figure 2-6 gives plots of the position, velocity, and acceleration of an ele-
vator moving up a shaft. Compare the a(t) curve with the v(t) curve — each
point on the a(t) curve shows the derivative (slope) of the v(t) curve at the
corresponding time. When v is constant (at either 0 or 4 m/s), the derivative is
zero and so also is the acceleration. When the cab first begins to move, the v(t)
curve has a positive derivative (the slope is positive), which means that a(t) is
positive. When the cab slows to a stop, the derivative and slope of the v(t)
curve are negative; that is, a(t) is negative.

Next compare the slopes of the v(t) curve during the two acceleration peri-
ods. The slope associated with the cab’s slowing down (commonly called “decel-
eration”) is steeper because the cab stops in half the time it took to get up to
speed. The steeper slope means that the magnitude of the deceleration is larger
than that of the acceleration, as indicated in Fig. 2-6c.

**Sensations.** The sensations you would feel while riding in the cab of
Fig. 2-6 are indicated by the sketched figures at the bottom. When the cab first
accelerates, you feel as though you are pressed downward; when later the cab is
braked to a stop, you seem to be stretched upward. In between, you feel nothing
special. In other words, your body reacts to accelerations (it is an accelerometer)
but not to velocities (it is not a speedometer). When you are in a car traveling at
90 km/h or an airplane traveling at 900 km/h, you have no bodily awareness of
the motion. However, if the car or plane quickly changes velocity, you may become keenly aware of the change, perhaps even frightened by it. Part of the thrill
of an amusement park ride is due to the quick changes of velocity that you undergo (you pay for the accelerations, not for the speed). A more extreme example
is shown in the photographs of Fig. 2-7, which were taken while a rocket sled was
rapidly accelerated along a track and then rapidly braked to a stop.

**g Units**. Large accelerations are sometimes expressed in terms of g units, with

.. math::

   1g = 9.8 m/s^2 (g unit).

(2-10)

(As we shall discuss in Module 2-5, g is the magnitude of the acceleration of a
falling object near Earth’s surface.) On a roller coaster, you may experience brief
accelerations up to 3g, which is (3)(9.8 m/s2), or about 29 m/s2, more than enough
to justify the cost of the ride.

Signs. In common language, the sign of an acceleration has a nonscientific
meaning: positive acceleration means that the speed of an object is increasing, and
negative acceleration means that the speed is decreasing (the object is decelerat-
ing). In this book, however, the sign of an acceleration indicates a direction, not
whether an object’s speed is increasing or decreasing. For example, if a car with an
initial velocity v " $25 m/s is braked to a stop in 5.0 s, then aavg " #5.0 m/s2. The
acceleration is positive, but the car’s speed has decreased. The reason is the differ-
ence in signs: the direction of the acceleration is opposite that of the velocity.
Here then is the proper way to interpret the signs:

If the signs of the velocity and acceleration of a particle are the same, the speed
of the particle increases. If the signs are opposite, the speed decreases.

Checkpoint 3

A wombat moves along an x axis. What is the sign of its acceleration if it is moving
(a) in the positive direction with increasing speed, (b) in the positive direction with
decreasing speed, (c) in the negative direction with increasing speed, and (d) in the
negative direction with decreasing speed?

Sample Problem 2.03 Acceleration and dv/dt

A particle’s position on the x axis of Fig. 2-1 is given by

.. math::

   x = 4 - 27t + t^3,

with x in meters and t in seconds.

(a) Because position x depends on time t, the particle must
be moving. Find the particle’s velocity function v(t) and ac-
celeration function a(t).

KEY IDEAS

(1) To get the velocity function v(t), we differentiate the po-
sition function x(t) with respect to time. (2) To get the accel-
eration function a(t), we differentiate the velocity function
v(t) with respect to time.

Calculations: Differentiating the position function, we find

.. math::

   v = -27 + 3t^2,

(Answer)

with v in meters per second. Differentiating the velocity
function then gives us

.. math::

   a = +6t,

(Answer)

with a in meters per second squared.

b) Is there ever a time when v = 0?

Calculation: Setting v(t) = 0 yields

.. math::

   0 = -27 + 3t^2,

which has the solution

.. math::

   t = \pm 3 s

Thus, the velocity is zero both 3 s before and 3 s after the
clock reads 0.

(c) Describe the particle’s motion for :math:`t \geq 0`.

Reasoning: We need to examine the expressions for x(t),
v(t), and a(t).

At t = 0, the particle is at x(0) = +4 m and is moving
with a velocity of v(0) " $27 m/s — that is, in the negative
direction of the x axis. Its acceleration is a(0) " 0 because just
then the particle’s velocity is not changing (Fig. 2-8a).

For 0 < t < 3 s, the particle still has a negative velocity,
so it continues to move in the negative direction. However,
its acceleration is no longer 0 but is increasing and positive.
Because the signs of the velocity and the acceleration are
opposite, the particle must be slowing (Fig. 2-8b).

Indeed, we already know that it stops momentarily at
t " 3 s. Just then the particle is as far to the left of the origin
in Fig. 2-1 as it will ever get. Substituting t " 3 s into the
expression for x(t), we find that the particle’s position just
then is x " $50 m (Fig. 2-8c). Its acceleration is still positive.

For t > 3 s, the particle moves to the right on the axis.
Its acceleration remains positive and grows progressively
larger in magnitude. The velocity is now positive, and it too
grows progressively larger in magnitude (Fig. 2-8d).

2-4 CONSTANT ACCELERATION
-------------------------

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .

2.13 For constant acceleration, apply the relationships between position, displacement, velocity, acceleration, and

Key Ideas

* The following five equations describe the motion of a particle with constant acceleration:

.. math::

   v = v_0 + at, x - x_0 = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2,

   v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a (x-x_0), x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2} (v_0 + v)t, x-x_0 = vt - \frac{1}{2} at^2

These are not valid when the acceleration is not constant.

Constant Acceleration: A Special Case
--------------------------------------

In many types of motion, the acceleration is either constant or approximately so.
For example, you might accelerate a car at an approximately constant rate when
a traffic light turns from red to green. Then graphs of your position, velocity,
and acceleration would resemble those in Fig. 2-9. (Note that a(t) in Fig. 2-9c is
constant, which requires that v(t) in Fig. 2-9b have a constant slope.) Later when
you brake the car to a stop, the acceleration (or deceleration in common
language) might also be approximately constant.

Such cases are so common that a special set of equations has been derived
for dealing with them. One approach to the derivation of these equations is given
in this section. A second approach is given in the next section. Throughout both
sections and later when you work on the homework problems, keep in mind that
these equations are valid only for constant acceleration (or situations in which you
can approximate the acceleration as being constant).

**First Basic Equation.** When the acceleration is constant, the average accel-
eration and instantaneous acceleration are equal and we can write Eq. 2-7, with
some changes in notation, as

.. math::

   a = a_{avg} = \frac{v - v_0}{t - 0}

Here v0 is the velocity at time t " 0 and v is the velocity at any later time t. We can
recast this equation as

.. math::

   v = v_0 + at

As a check, note that this equation reduces to v " v0 for t " 0, as it must. As a fur-
ther check, take the derivative of Eq. 2-11. Doing so yields dv/dt " a, which is the
definition of a. Figure 2-9b shows a plot of Eq. 2-11, the v(t) function; the function
is linear and thus the plot is a straight line.

**Second Basic Equation.** In a similar manner, we can rewrite Eq. 2-2 (with a
few changes in notation) as

.. math::

   v_{avg} = \frac{x-x_0}{t -0}

and then as

.. math::

   x = x_0 + v_{avg}t,
(2-12)

in which x0 is the position of the particle at t " 0 and vavg is the average velocity
between t " 0 and a later time t.

For the linear velocity function in Eq. 2-11, the average velocity over any time
interval (say, from t " 0 to a later time t) is the average of the velocity at the be-
ginning of the interval (" v0) and the velocity at the end of the interval (" v). For
the interval from t " 0 to the later time t then, the average velocity is

.. math::

   v_{avg} = \frac{1}{2} (v_0 + v).

(2-13)

Substituting the right side of Eq. 2-11 for v yields, after a little rearrangement,

.. math::

   v_{avg} = v_0 + \frac{1}{2} at.
(2-14)

Finally, substituting Eq. 2-14 into Eq. 2-12 yields

.. math::

   x - x_0 = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} at^2.

(2-15)

As a check, note that putting t " 0 yields x " x0, as it must. As a further check,
taking the derivative of Eq. 2-15 yields Eq. 2-11, again as it must. Figure 2-9a
shows a plot of Eq. 2-15; the function is quadratic and thus the plot is curved.

Three Other Equations. Equations 2-11 and 2-15 are the basic equations for
constant acceleration; they can be used to solve any constant acceleration prob-
lem in this book. However, we can derive other equations that might prove useful
in certain specific situations. First, note that as many as five quantities can possi-
bly be involved in any problem about constant acceleration — namely, x $ x0, v, t,
a, and v0. Usually, one of these quantities is not involved in the problem, either as
a given or as an unknown. We are then presented with three of the remaining
quantities and asked to find the fourth.

Equations 2-11 and 2-15 each contain four of these quantities, but not the
same four. In Eq. 2-11, the “missing ingredient” is the displacement x $ x0. In Eq.
2-15, it is the velocity v. These two equations can also be combined in three ways
to yield three additional equations, each of which involves a different “missing
variable.” First, we can eliminate t to obtain

.. math::

   v^2 = v^2_0 + 2a(x - x_0).
(2-16)

This equation is useful if we do not know t and are not required to find it. Second,
we can eliminate the acceleration a between Eqs. 2-11 and 2-15 to produce an
equation in which a does not appear:

.. math::

   x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v)t

Finally, we can eliminate v0, obtaining

.. math::

   x - x_0 = vt - \frac{1}{2}a t^2


Note the subtle difference between this equation and Eq. 2-15. One involves the
initial velocity v0; the other involves the velocity v at time t.

Table 2-1 lists the basic constant acceleration equations (Eqs. 2-11 and 2-15) as
well as the specialized equations that we have derived.To solve a simple constant ac-
celeration problem, you can usually use an equation from this list (if you have the
list with you). Choose an equation for which the only unknown variable is the vari-
able requested in the problem. A simpler plan is to remember only Eqs. 2-11 and
2-15, and then solve them as simultaneous equations whenever needed.

Checkpoint 4

The following equations give the position x(t) of a particle in four situations: (1) 
:math:`x = 3t - 4; (2) x = -5t^3 + 4t^2 + 6; (3) x = 2/t^2 - 4/t; (4) x = 5t^2 - 3`. To which of these
situations do the equations of Table 2-1 apply?

Sample Problem 2.04 Drag race of car and motorcycle

A popular web video shows a jet airplane, a car, and a mo-
torcycle racing from rest along a runway (Fig. 2-10). Initially
the motorcycle takes the lead, but then the jet takes the lead,
and finally the car blows past the motorcycle. Here let’s focus
on the car and motorcycle and assign some reasonable values
to the motion. The motorcycle first takes the lead because its
(constant) acceleration am " 8.40 m/s2 is greater than the car’s
(constant) acceleration ac " 5.60 m/s2, but it soon loses to the
car because it reaches its greatest speed vm " 58.8 m/s before
the car reaches its greatest speed vc " 106 m/s. How long does
the car take to reach the motorcycle?

KEY IDEAS

We can apply the equations of constant acceleration to both
vehicles, but for the motorcycle we must consider the mo-
tion in two stages: (1) First it travels through distance xm1
with zero initial velocity and acceleration am " 8.40 m/s2,
reaching speed vm " 58.8 m/s. (2) Then it travels through dis-
tance xm2 with constant velocity vm " 58.8 m/s and zero ac-
celeration (that, too, is a constant acceleration). (Note that
we symbolized the distances even though we do not know
their values. Symbolizing unknown quantities is often help-
ful in solving physics problems, but introducing such un-
knowns sometimes takes physics courage.)

Calculations: So that we can draw figures and do calcula-
tions, let’s assume that the vehicles race along the positive di-
rection of an x axis, starting from x " 0 at time t " 0. (We can
choose any initial numbers because we are looking for the
elapsed time, not a particular time in, say, the afternoon, but
let’s stick with these easy numbers.) We want the car to pass
the motorcycle, but what does that mean mathematically?

It means that at some time t, the side-by-side vehicles
are at the same coordinate: xc for the car and the sum xm1 #
xm2 for the motorcycle. We can write this statement mathe-
matically as

.. math:: 

   x_c = x_{m1} + x_{m2}
(2-19)
xc " xm1 # xm2.

(Writing this first step is the hardest part of the problem.
That is true of most physics problems. How do you go from
the problem statement (in words) to a mathematical expres-
sion? One purpose of this book is for you to build up that
ability of writing the first step — it takes lots of practice just
as in learning, say, tae-kwon-do.)

Now let’s fill out both sides of Eq. 2-19, left side first. To
reach the passing point at xc, the car accelerates from rest. From
Eq. 2-15 (:math:`x - x_0 = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2`), with x0 and v0 = 0, we have

.. math::

   x_c = \frac{1}{2} a_c t^2.

(2-20)

To write an expression for xm1 for the motorcycle, we
first find the time tm it takes to reach its maximum speed vm,
using Eq. 2-11 (v " v0 # at). Substituting v0 " 0, v " vm "
58.8 m/s, and a " am " 8.40 m/s2, that time is

.. math::

   t_m = \frac{v_m}{a_m} = \frac{58.8 m/s}{8.40 m/s^2} = 7.00 s

To get the distance xm1 traveled by the motorcycle during
the first stage, we again use Eq. 2-15 with x0 " 0 and v0 " 0,
but we also substitute from Eq. 2-21 for the time. We find

.. math::

   x_{m1} = \frac{1}{2} a_m t_m^2 =\frac{1}{2}a_m (\frac{v_m}{a_m})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{v_m^2}{a_m}

For the remaining time of t $ tm , the motorcycle travels
at its maximum speed with zero acceleration. To get the
distance, we use Eq. 2-15 for this second stage of the motion,
but now the initial velocity is v0 " vm (the speed at the end
of the first stage) and the acceleration is a " 0. So, the dis-
tance traveled during the second stage is

.. math::

   x_{m2} = v_m(t - t_m) = v_m(t - 7.00 s).
(2-23)

To finish the calculation, we substitute Eqs. 2-20, 2-22, and
2-23 into Eq. 2-19, obtaining

.. math::

   \frac{1}{2} a_c t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{v_m^2}{a_m} + v_m (t - 7.00 s)

This is a quadratic equation. Substituting in the given data,
we solve the equation (by using the usual quadratic-equa-
tion formula or a polynomial solver on a calculator), finding
t " 4.44 s and t " 16.6 s.

But what do we do with two answers? Does the car pass
the motorcycle twice? No, of course not, as we can see in the
video. So, one of the answers is mathematically correct but
not physically meaningful. Because we know that the car
passes the motorcycle after the motorcycle reaches its maxi-
mum speed at t " 7.00 s, we discard the solution with t (
7.00 s as being the unphysical answer and conclude that the
passing occurs at

.. math::

   t = 16.6 s.
(Answer)

Figure 2-11 is a graph of the position versus time for
the two vehicles, with the passing point marked. Notice
that at t " 7.00 s the plot for the motorcycle switches from
being curved (because the speed had been increasing) to being straight (because the speed is thereafter constant).


Another Look at Constant Acceleration*
--------------------------------------

The first two equations in Table 2-1 are the basic equations from which the others
are derived. Those two can be obtained by integration of the acceleration with
the condition that a is constant. To find Eq. 2-11, we rewrite the definition of ac-
celeration (Eq. 2-8) as

.. math::

   dv = a dt.

We next write the indefinite integral (or antiderivative) of both sides:

.. math::

  \int dv = \int a dt

Since acceleration a is a constant, it can be taken outside the integration. We obtain

.. math::

   \int dv = a \int dt

   or v = at + C

To evaluate the constant of integration C, we let t " 0, at which time v " v0.
Substituting these values into Eq. 2-25 (which must hold for all values of t,
including t " 0) yields

.. math::

   v_0 = (a)(0) + C = C

Substituting this into Eq. 2-25 gives us Eq. 2-11.

To derive Eq. 2-15, we rewrite the definition of velocity (Eq. 2-4) as

.. math::

   dx = v dt

and then take the indefinite integral of both sides to obtain

.. math::

   \int dx = \int v dt

Next, we substitute for v with Eq. 2-11:

.. math::

   \int dx = \int (v_0 + at) dt

Since v0 is a constant, as is the acceleration a, this can be rewritten as

.. math::

   \int dx = v_0 \int dt + a \int t dt


Integration now yields

.. math::

   x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2} at^2 + C',
(2-26)

where C' is another constant of integration. At time t = 0, we have x = x0.
Substituting these values in Eq. 2-26 yields x0 = C'. Replacing C' with x0 in Eq.
2-26 gives us Eq. 2-15.

2-5 FREE-FALL ACCELERATION

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .

2.16 Identify that if a particle is in free flight (whether
upward or downward) and if we can neglect the
effects of air on its motion, the particle has a constant
downward acceleration with a magnitude g that we take to
be 9.8 m/s2.

2.17 Apply the constant-acceleration equations (Table 2-1) to
free-fall motion.

Key Ideas

* An important example of straight-line motion with constant
acceleration is that of an object rising or falling freely near
Earth’s surface. The constant acceleration equations de-
scribe this motion, but we make two changes in notation:
(1) we refer the motion to the vertical y axis with #y vertically
up; (2) we replace a with -g, where g is the magnitude of the
free-fall acceleration. Near Earth’s surface,

.. math::

   g = 9.8 m/s^2 = 32 ft/s^2.

Free-Fall Acceleration
----------------------

If you tossed an object either up or down and could somehow eliminate the
effects of air on its flight, you would find that the object accelerates downward at
a certain constant rate. That rate is called the free-fall acceleration, and its magni-
tude is represented by g. The acceleration is independent of the object’s charac-
teristics, such as mass, density, or shape; it is the same for all objects.

Two examples of free-fall acceleration are shown in Fig. 2-12, which is a series
of stroboscopic photos of a feather and an apple. As these objects fall, they
accelerate downward — both at the same rate g. Thus, their speeds increase at the
same rate, and they fall together.

The value of g varies slightly with latitude and with elevation. At sea level
in Earth’s midlatitudes the value is 9.8 m/s2 (or 32 ft/s2), which is what you
should use as an exact number for the problems in this book unless otherwise
noted.

The equations of motion in Table 2-1 for constant acceleration also apply to
free fall near Earth’s surface; that is, they apply to an object in vertical flight,
either up or down, when the effects of the air can be neglected. However, note
that for free fall: (1) The directions of motion are now along a vertical y axis
instead of the x axis, with the positive direction of y upward. (This is important
for later chapters when combined horizontal and vertical motions are examined.)
(2) The free-fall acceleration is negative — that is, downward on the y axis, toward
Earth’s center — and so it has the value $g in the equations.

The free-fall acceleration near Earth’s surface is a = -g = -9.8 m/s2, and the
magnitude of the acceleration is g " 9.8 m/s2. Do not substitute $9.8 m/s2 for g.

Suppose you toss a tomato directly upward with an initial (positive) velocity v0
and then catch it when it returns to the release level. During its free-fall flight (from
just after its release to just before it is caught), the equations of Table 2-1 apply to its
motion. The acceleration is always a " $g " $9.8 m/s2, negative and thus down-
ward. The velocity, however, changes, as indicated by Eqs. 2-11 and 2-16: during the
ascent, the magnitude of the positive velocity decreases, until it momentarily be-
comes zero. Because the tomato has then stopped, it is at its maximum height.
During the descent, the magnitude of the (now negative) velocity increases.

Checkpoint 5

(a) If you toss a ball straight up, what is the sign of the ball’s displacement for the ascent,
from the release point to the highest point? (b) What is it for the descent, from the highest point back to the release point? (c) What is the ball’s acceleration at its highest point?

Sample Problem 2.05 Time for full up-down flight, baseball toss

In Fig. 2-13, a pitcher tosses a baseball up along a y axis, with
an initial speed of 12 m/s.

(a) How long does the ball take to reach its maximum height?

KEY IDEAS

(1) Once the ball leaves the pitcher and before it returns to
his hand, its acceleration is the free-fall acceleration a=-g.
Because this is constant, Table 2-1 applies to the motion.
(2) The velocity v at the maximum height must be 0.

Calculation: Knowing v, a, and the initial velocity
v0 = 12 m/s, and seeking t, we solve Eq. 2-11, which contains
those four variables. This yields

.. math::

   t = \frac{v - v_0}{a} = \frac{0 - 12 m/s}{-9.8 m/s^2} = 1.2 s

(Answer)

(b) What is the ball’s maximum height above its release point?

Calculation: We can take the ball’s release point to be y0 = 0.
We can then write Eq. 2-16 in y notation, set y - y0 = y and v = 0
(at the maximum height), and solve for y.We get

.. math::

   t = \frac{v^2 - v_0^2}{2a} = \frac{0 - 12 m/s}{2(-9.8 m/s^2)} = 7.3 m

(Answer)

(c) How long does the ball take to reach a point 5.0 m above
its release point?

Calculations: We know v0, a = -g, and displacement y -y0 = 5.0 m, and we want t, so we choose Eq. 2-15. Rewriting
it for y and setting y0 = 0 give us

.. math::

   y = v0 t - \frac{1}{2} gt^2,

or 5.0 m = (12 m/s)t - (12)(9.8 m/s2)t 2.

If we temporarily omit the units (having noted that they are
consistent), we can rewrite this as

.. math::

   4.9t^2 - 12t + 5.0 = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation for t yields

.. math::

   t = 0.53 s and t = 1.9 s.
(Answer)

There are two such times! This is not really surprising
because the ball passes twice through y = 5.0 m, once on the
way up and once on the way down.

2-6 GRAPHICAL INTEGRATION IN MOTION ANALYSIS
---------------------------------------------

Learning Objectives

After reading this module, you should be able to . . .

2.19 Determine a particle’s change in position by graphical
integration on a graph of velocity versus time.

2.18 Determine a particle’s change in velocity by graphical
integration on a graph of acceleration versus time.


Key Ideas

* On a graph of acceleration a versus time t, the change in
the velocity is given by

.. math::

   v_1 - v_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1}


The integral amounts to finding an area on the graph:

.. mayh::

   \int_{t_0}^{t_1} = (area between acceleration curve an time axis , from t0 to t1)

* On a graph of velocity v versus time t, the change in the
position is given by

.. math::

   x_1 - x_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} v dt

where the integral can be taken from the graph as


   \int_{t_0}^{t_1} v dt = (area between velocity curve an time axis , from t0 to t1)


Graphical Integration in Motion Analysis
-----------------------------------------

**Integrating Acceleration.** When we have a graph of an object’s acceleration a ver-
sus time t, we can integrate on the graph to find the velocity at any given time.
Because a is defined as a " dv/dt, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that

.. math::

   v_1 - v_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} a dt

(2-27)

The right side of the equation is a definite integral (it gives a numerical result rather
than a function), v0 is the velocity at time t0, and v1 is the velocity at later time t1.The def-
inite integral can be evaluated from an a(t) graph,such as in Fig.2-14a.In particular,

.. math::

   \int_{t_0}^{t_1} a dt = (area beteen acceleration curve and time axis, from t_0 to t_1)

(2-28)

If a unit of acceleration is 1 m/s2 and a unit of time is 1 s, then the correspon-
ding unit of area on the graph is

.. math

   (1 m/s^2)(1 s) = 1 m/s,

which is (properly) a unit of velocity. When the acceleration curve is above the time
axis, the area is positive; when the curve is below the time axis, the area is negative.

**Integrating Velocity.** Similarly, because velocity v is defined in terms of the posi-
tion x as v = dx/dt, then

.. math::

   x_1 - x_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} v dt

where x0 is the position at time t0 and x1 is the position at time t1. The definite
integral on the right side of Eq. 2-29 can be evaluated from a v(t) graph, like that
shown in Fig. 2-14b. In particular,

.. math::

   \int_{t_0}^{t_1} = (area between velocity curve and time axis, from t_0 to t_1)

If the unit of velocity is 1 m/s and the unit of time is 1 s, then the corre-
sponding unit of area on the graph is

.. math::

   (1 m/s)(1 s) = 1 m,

which is (properly) a unit of position and displacement. Whether this area is posi-
tive or negative is determined as described for the a(t) curve of Fig. 2-14a.

Sample Problem 2.06 Graphical integration a versus t, whiplash injury

“Whiplash injury” commonly occurs in a rear-end collision
where a front car is hit from behind by a second car. In the
1970s, researchers concluded that the injury was due to the
occupant’s head being whipped back over the top of the seat
as the car was slammed forward. As a result of this finding,
head restraints were built into cars, yet neck injuries in rear-
end collisions continued to occur.

In a recent test to study neck injury in rear-end collisions,
a volunteer was strapped to a seat that was then moved
abruptly to simulate a collision by a rear car moving at
10.5 km/h. Figure 2-15a gives the accelerations of the volun-
teer’s torso and head during the collision, which began at time
t " 0. The torso acceleration was delayed by 40 ms because
during that time interval the seat back had to compress
against the volunteer. The head acceleration was delayed by
an additional 70 ms. What was the torso speed when the head
began to accelerate?


KEY IDEA

We can calculate the torso speed at any time by finding an
area on the torso a(t) graph.

Calculations: We know that the initial torso speed is v0 = 0
at time t0 = 0, at the start of the “collision.” We want the
torso speed v1 at time t1 " 110 ms, which is when the head
begins to accelerate.

Combining Eqs. 2-27 and 2-28, we can write

.. math:

   v_1 - v_0 = (area between acceleration curve and time axis, from t0 to t1)

For convenience, let us separate the area into three regions
(Fig. 2-15b). From 0 to 40 ms, region A has no area:

.. math::

   area_A = 0

From 40 ms to 100 ms, region B has the shape of a triangle, with
area

.. math::

   areaB " 12(0.060 s)(50 m/s2) " 1.5 m/s.

From 100 ms to 110 ms, region C has the shape of a rectan-
gle, with area

.. math::

   areaC " (0.010 s)(50 m/s2) " 0.50 m/s.

Substituting these values and v0 = 0 into Eq. 2-31 gives us

.. math::

   v_1 - 0 = 0 + 1.5 m/s + 0.50 m/s

or  v1 = 2.0 m/s = 7.2 km/h.
(Answer)

Comments: When the head is just starting to move forward,
the torso already has a speed of 7.2 km/h. Researchers argue
that it is this difference in speeds during the early stage of a
rear-end collision that injures the neck. The backward whip-
ping of the head happens later and could, especially if there is
no head restraint, increase the injury.

Review & Summary
----------------

**Position** The position x of a particle on an x axis locates the par-
ticle with respect to the origin, or zero point, of the axis.The position
is either positive or negative, according to which side of the origin
the particle is on, or zero if the particle is at the origin. The positive
direction on an axis is the direction of increasing positive numbers;
the opposite direction is the negative direction on the axis.

**Displacement** The displacement :math:`\Delta x` of a particle is the change

.. math::

   \Delta = x_2 - x_1


Displacement is a vector quantity. It is positive if the particle has
moved in the positive direction of the x axis and negative if the
particle has moved in the negative direction.

**Average Velocity** When a particle has moved from position x1
to position x2 during a time interval :math:`\Delta t = t_2 - t_1`, its average velocity
during that interval is

.. math::

   v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2-x_1}{t_2-t_1}

The algebraic sign of vavg indicates the direction of motion (vavg is a
vector quantity). Average velocity does not depend on the actual
distance a particle moves, but instead depends on its original and
final positions.

On a graph of x versus t, the average velocity for a time interval :math:`\Delta t`
is the slope of the straight line connecting the points on the curve
that represent the two ends of the interval.

**Average Speed** The average speed savg of a particle during a
time interval :math:`\Delta t` depends on the total distance the particle moves in
that time interval:

.. math::

   s_{avg} = \frac{total distance}{\Delta t}

(2-3)

**Instantaneous Velocity** The instantaneous velocity (or sim-
ply velocity) v of a moving particle is

.. math::

   v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}


where :math:`Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t` are defined by Eq. 2-2. The instantaneous velocity
(at a particular time) may be found as the slope (at that particular
time) of the graph of x versus t. **Speed** is the magnitude of instanta-
neous velocity.

**Average Acceleration** Average acceleration is the ratio of a
change in velocity :math:`\Delta v` to the time interval :math:`Delta t` in which the change occurs:

.. math::

   a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}

The algebraic sign indicates the direction of aavg.

**Instantaneous Acceleration** Instantaneous acceleration (or
simply acceleration) a is the first time derivative of velocity v(t)
and the second time derivative of position x(t):

.. math::

   a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}

On a graph of v versus t, the acceleration a at any time t is the slope
of the curve at the point that represents t.

**Constant Acceleration** The five equations in Table 2-1
describe the motion of a particle with constant acceleration:

.. math::

   v = v_0 + at

   x-x_0 = v_0t + \frac{1}{2} at^2

   v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)

   x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2} (v_0 + v)t

   x - x_0 = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2

These are not valid when the acceleration is not constant.

**Free-Fall Acceleration** An important example of straight-
line motion with constant acceleration is that of an object rising or
falling freely near Earth’s surface. The constant acceleration equa-
tions describe this motion, but we make two changes in notation:
(1) we refer the motion to the vertical y axis with #y vertically up;
(2) we replace a with $g, where g is the magnitude of the free-fall
acceleration. Near Earth’s surface, g = 9.8 m/s2 (= 32 ft/s2).

the mushroom, a drop grows on one side of the spore and a film
grows on the other side. The spore is bent over by the drop’s weight,
