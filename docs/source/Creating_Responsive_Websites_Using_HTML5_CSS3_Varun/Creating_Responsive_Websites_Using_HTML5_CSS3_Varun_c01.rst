CHAPTER 1

Introduction to Web Development
===============================

This chapter will cover why web development is needed in today’s digital
world, how web development is done, and which technologies are capable
of creating world-class and high-performing websites. Web developers
need to know how HTML and CSS work, which will be covered in depth.
I will briefly explain HTML elements and page structure so you can
understand how HTML and CSS work in conjunction to create websites. I
will also explain the problem that CSS solves and how to write CSS code.

Need for Web Development
------------------------

Web development has become an increasingly vital aspect of modern
life. The Internet has become an essential part of our daily routine, from
shopping and entertainment to social media and education. With the
constant expansion of the digital world, the demand for web development
has grown exponentially.

Web development refers to the creation and maintenance of websites,
web applications, and other online platforms. It involves a wide range of
skills, including programming languages, database management, and
graphic design. Web developers work together to create websites that are
user-friendly, visually appealing, and accessible to a broad audience.

One of the most significant reasons why web development is so
essential is the rise of e-commerce. With an increasing number of people
who shop online, businesses are realizing the importance of having
an online presence. Websites are now more than just a way to provide
information about a company; they are a critical tool for generating
revenue. A well-designed website can attract more customers, increase
brand awareness, and ultimately boost sales.

Web development is also crucial for the education sector. With
the growth of e-learning, schools and universities need to have online
platforms that provide easy access to course materials, discussions, and
online assessments. This allows for a more flexible learning experience,
making education more accessible to students who may not be able to
attend traditional classrooms.

Moreover, web development has become essential in the healthcare
industry. With the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers have had
to shift to telemedicine and virtual consultations. The development of
online platforms has been crucial in providing care to patients, enabling
doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely. There are many such
examples where technology has served a better and convenient means of
accomplishing our daily tasks.

In addition to the practical uses, web development has become
an essential tool for communication and entertainment. Social media
platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, have become a significant part
of our daily lives. These platforms rely heavily on web development to
provide users with an engaging and user-friendly experience.

In conclusion, web development is crucial for our modern-day world.
It has become an essential tool for businesses, education, healthcare,
and communication. As the Internet continues to evolve, the demand for
web development will only increase. With the right skills and tools, web
developers can help create websites and online platforms that are both
functional and visually appealing, making the Internet a better place for
everyone. The next section explains which technologies you can use.

Technologies Used in Web Development
------------------------------------

The technologies used in web development have evolved significantly over
the years, with new frameworks, tools, and languages emerging to improve
the performance, functionality, and user experience of websites. Here are
some of the key technologies that have evolved in web development. This
book will be focusing on HTML and CSS.

• HTML: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) has been the backbone of web development since the early days of the Internet. HTML has evolved over  
time, with new versions introducing new elements and features that make it easier to create complex websites and applications.

• CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style and lay out web pages. CSS has evolved to include new features, such as flexboxes, grids, 
and animations, that make it easier to create sophisticated designs and interactive user experiences.

• JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used to create interactive websites and applications. JavaScript has evolved significantly over 
the years, with new libraries and frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular making it easier to create complex web applications.

• Server-side languages: Server-side languages such as PHP, Python, and Ruby on Rails are used to create dynamic web applications that interact 
with databases and other server-side components. These languages have evolved to become more efficient and scalable, enabling developers to build 
complex web applications.

• Web APIs: Web application programming interfaces (APIs) allow web developers to integrate with other web services and data sources. Web APIs 
have evolved to include new standards such as RESTful APIs, which provide a simple and flexible way to interact with web services.

• Cloud computing: Cloud computing has transformed web development by providing a scalable and flexible infrastructure for web applications. 
Cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure allow developers to deploy and manage web applications with ease.

• Progressive web apps: Progressive web apps (PWAs) are web applications that provide a user experience similar to native apps. PWAs have evolved 
to include new features such as service workers, which allow web applications to work offline and provide push notifications.

• Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in web development to improve user experiences and provide new 
functionality. AI-powered chatbots, for example, can provide instant customer support, while machine  learning algorithms can personalize content 
and improve search results.

In conclusion, web development is the process of creating websites
and web applications that are accessible through the Internet. It involves
various aspects such as front-end development, back-end development,
and web design. Web development has come a long way since the early
days of the Internet, with new technologies and frameworks emerging to
improve performance, functionality, and user experience. HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, server-side languages, web APIs, cloud computing, PWAs,
and AI are some of the key technologies that have transformed web
development. As the Internet continues to evolve, web development
will continue to play an increasingly important role in shaping the
digital landscape. With the growing demand for online services and the
increasing complexity of web applications, web development is poised to
remain an exciting and dynamic field for years to come.

How HTML Works in a Web Browser
-------------------------------

HTML is the backbone of the modern Web. It is the standard markup
language used to create web pages, and it provides a way for developers
to structure content and define its meaning. However, HTML doesn’t
work exactly the same way on all web browsers, and understanding these
differences is crucial for building websites that work well across different
platforms.

Web browsers are software applications that retrieve and display web
pages from the Internet. There are several popular web browsers available
today, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and
Microsoft Edge; older browsers include Opera and Netscape Navigator.
Each browser has its own rendering engine, which is responsible for
interpreting and displaying HTML code.
Figure 1-1 shows some HTML code.

Figure 1-1. Hello world HTML code

The rendering engine is the part of the browser that takes the HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript code and turns it into a visual representation on the
screen. It parses the HTML and constructs a document object model
(DOM), which is a treelike structure that represents the content and
structure of the web page (Figure 1-2). The rendering engine then uses the
DOM and CSS to determine how the web page should be displayed.

Figure 1-2. DOM tree for the HTML code

Different browsers have different rendering engines, which can lead to
variations in how web pages are displayed. For example, some browsers
may handle HTML and CSS in slightly different ways, leading to differences
in layout and formatting. Additionally, different browsers may support
different HTML features, which can impact how certain elements of a web
page are displayed.

To ensure that web pages work well across different browsers,
developers need to be aware of these differences and test their pages on
multiple platforms. They can also use tools such as browser compatibility
checkers to identify any issues that may arise when viewing their pages on
different browsers.

In general, modern web browsers have good support for HTML5,
which is the latest version of the HTML standard. This means developers
can use the latest HTML features to create dynamic, interactive web pages
that work well across different platforms.

Despite these efforts, however, there are still some differences in
how HTML is interpreted and displayed across different browsers. These
differences can be minor or significant, depending on the complexity of
the web page and the specific features being used.

To overcome these differences, web developers can use a technique
called browser sniffing, which involves detecting the specific browser
being used and tailoring the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code accordingly.
However, this technique can be complex and may not always be reliable,
so it’s important for developers to stay up-to-date with the latest web
standards and best practices.

HTML Elements
-------------

HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages, and they define
the structure and content of the page. Each HTML element is surrounded
by opening and closing tags, which tell the browser how to display the
content. Though almost all of the tags have opening and closing tags, e.g.,
<tag_name></tag_name>, some tags have just the opening tag like <img>,
<hr/>, etc. We are going to take a look at various HTML elements that are
used to create web pages.

HTML elements can be categorized into several groups based on
their function. Some of the most common categories include structural
elements, text elements, multimedia elements, form elements, and
scripting elements.

Structural Elements
-------------------

Structural elements are used to define the overall structure of the web page.
They include elements such as the <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body>
tags. The <html> tag is used to define the document type, while the <head>
tag contains information about the document, such as the title, author, and
description. The <body> tag contains the main content of the web page.

Text Elements
------------

Text elements are used to add text content to the web page. They include
elements such as the <p>, <h1>–<h6>, and <em> tags. The <p> tag is used
to create paragraphs, while the <h1>–<h6> tags are used to create headings
of different sizes. The <em> tag is used to emphasize text, while the
<strong> tag is used to highlight important text.
Here is an example of a heading tag:

.. code:: html

   <html>
      <body>
         <h1>This text is Heading 1.</h1>
         <h2>This text is Heading 2.</h2>
         <h3>This text is Heading 3.</h3>
         <h4>This text is Heading 4.</h4>
         <h5>This text is Heading 5.</h5>
         <h6>This text is Heading 6.</h6>
      </body>
   </html>

Figure 1-3 shows an HTML file containing heading tag elements.

Figure 1-3. HTML displaying how heading 1 to heading 6 is
displayed in a browser

Here is a code example of <p>:

.. code:: html

   <html>
      <body>
         <p>
              This paragraph is written inside &lt;p&gt; element.
              It will be displayed as continous text in the
              browser.
              Let us see how does it look on the browser.
         </p>
      </body>
   </html>

Figure 1-4 shows how it looks in a browser.

Figure 1-4. HTML rendering <p> element text in browser

Multimedia Elements
-------------------

Multimedia elements are used to add multimedia content to the web page,
such as images and videos. They include elements such as the <img> and
<video> tags. The <img> tag is used to display images, while the <video>
tag is used to display videos.
Here is a code example for <img>:

.. code:: html

   <html>
      <body>
         <img src="../../../html dom.jpg" alt="dom image">
      </body>
   </html>

Figure 1-5. HTML DOM structure

Form Elements
-------------

Form elements are used to create forms on the web page, which allow
users to input information. They include elements such as the <form>,
<input>, and <button> tags. The <form> tag is used to create the form,
while the <input> tag is used to create input fields for the user to enter
information. The <button> tag is used to create buttons that the user can
click to submit the form. We are going to take a deeper look at the form
elements later in this book.

Scripting Elements
------------------

Scripting elements are used to add interactivity to the web page, such as
animations and user interface elements. They include elements such as
the <script> and <canvas> tags. The <script> tag is used to add JavaScript
code to the web page, while the <canvas> tag is used to create graphics and
animations. We will learn about scripts and animation in later chapters.

In addition to these categories, there are many other HTML elements
that can be used to create web pages. Some of these elements are used
for more specialized purposes, such as the <audio> tag for playing audio
files or the <iframe> tag for embedding external web pages within the
current page.

It’s important to note that HTML elements are not the only component
of a web page. Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript are also used to
define the visual appearance and interactivity of the page, respectively.
However, HTML elements provide the foundation for the page and define
its overall structure and content.

In conclusion, HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages.
They define the structure and content of the page, and they are used to
create everything from text to multimedia to forms and interactivity. By
understanding the different types of HTML elements and how they are
used, web developers can create rich and engaging web pages that are easy
to navigate and interact with.

HTML Page Structure
-------------------

An HTML page structure is composed of several different elements, each
with its own purpose and function.

The Basic Structure of an HTML Page
-----------------------------------

An HTML page consists of several different parts, including the doctype,
the head, and the body. The doctype is the first element in the page and
tells the browser what version of HTML is being used. The head element
contains information about the page that is not displayed to the user,
such as the page title, meta tags, and links to external resources. The body
element contains the main content of the page, including text, images, and
other multimedia elements.

Let’s take a closer look at each of the HTML page structure elements
and their role in the page:

• <!DOCTYPE html>: The <!DOCTYPE html> element is the first element in an HTML page and tells the browser what version of HTML is being used. The 
latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for HTML5 is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.

• <html>: The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page and is used to define the entire structure of the page. It contains all the 
other elements of the page, including the head and body elements.

• <head>: The <head> element is used to provide information about the page that is not displayed to the user, such as the page title, meta tags, 
and links to external resources. The content within the head element is not visible to the user and is used by the browser to display the page 
correctly.

• <title>: The <title> element is used to define the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser’s title bar and can also be used by 
search engines to display the page title in search results.

• <meta>: The <meta> element is used to provide additional information about the page, such as the page description, author, and keywords. These 
meta tags are used by search engines to help rank the page in search results.

• <link>: The <link> element is used to link to external resources, such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, or other HTML pages.

• <body>: The <body> element contains the main content of the page, including text, images, and other multimedia elements. It is the visible part 
of the page that the user interacts with.

• <header>: The <header> element is used to define the header section of the page, which typically contains the site logo, navigation menu, and 
other header content.

• <main>: The <main> element is used to define the main content section of the page, which contains the primary content of the page.

• <footer>: The <footer> element is used to define the footer section of the page, which typically contains copyright information, contact 
information, and other footer content.

The HTML page structure is composed of several different elements,
each with its own purpose and function. By understanding the basic
structure of an HTML page and the role of each element, web developers
can create well-structured and organized web pages that are easy to
navigate and interact with. Additionally, adhering to best practices for
HTML page structure can improve the page’s search engine optimization
(SEO) and overall user experience.

How CSS Works
-------------

Cascading Style Sheets is a technology used to define the look and feel of
websites. CSS works by separating the presentation layer from the content
layer of a web page, allowing designers to control the visual aspects of a
site without affecting the underlying HTML code.

The basic principle of CSS is to apply styles to HTML elements. CSS
styles are defined in a separate file or in a style block within the HTML
file. Styles are written using a syntax that defines the type of element being
styled, followed by the properties and values that define the appearance of
the element.

For example, to define a style for a paragraph element, the following
syntax might be used:

.. code:: html

   p {
      font-family: Arial;
      font-size: 22px;
      color: #bb0d10;
   }

HTML Code:

.. code:: html

   <html>
      <body>
         <p>
            The properties font-family, font-size, and color
            are then defined, which set the font, font size,
            and color of the text within the paragraph element.
         </p>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../css/example.css">
      </body>
   </html>

Figure 1-6 shows what this code looks like in a browser.

Figure 1-6. CSS applied the font color for the <p> element

In this example, the p selector targets all <p> elements in the HTML
file. The properties font-family, font-size, and color are then defined, which
set the font, font size, and color of the text within the paragraph element.

CSS works by flowing styles down from the parent element to its
children. This means that if a style is defined for a parent element, it will be
inherited by its child elements unless a different style is explicitly defined.
For example, if a style is defined for the <body> element of a page, all
elements within the body will inherit that style unless a different style is
specified.

In addition to being cascading, CSS uses specificity to determine which
styles should be applied to an element. Specificity refers to the weight or
importance of a style rule. Styles with a higher specificity will override
styles with a lower specificity. Specificity is determined by a combination
of selectors, with more specific selectors taking precedence over less
specific ones.

For example, a style rule that targets a specific ID will have a higher
specificity than a rule that targets a class or element. The following
example demonstrates this:

.. code:: html

   #header {
      background-color: blue;
   }

   .header {
      background-color: red;
   }

Here’s the HTML code:

.. code:: html

   <html>
      <body>
         <h1 id="header" class="header">This text is
         Heading 1.</h1>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../css/example.css">
      </body>
   </html>

As shown in Figure 1-7, the style rule that targets the #header ID will be
applied, even though the .header class rule comes later in the file.

Figure 1-7. Heading text with background color modified by CSS

CSS also provides a range of layout and positioning options that
allow designers to control the placement and arrangement of elements
on a page. These include the float property, which allows elements to be
positioned next to each other, and the position property, which allows
elements to be positioned absolutely or relatively within their parent
element.

In addition to these basic concepts, CSS provides a wide range of
advanced features and techniques, such as media queries, animation, and
responsive design. These features allow designers to create dynamic and
interactive websites that adapt to a variety of screen sizes and devices. We
are going to cover all these topics in later chapters.

CSS is a powerful technology that allows designers to control the
appearance of web pages in a flexible and modular way. By separating the
presentation layer from the content layer, CSS enables designers to create
sophisticated and engaging websites that are easy to maintain and update.
With its powerful layout and positioning options and advanced features,
CSS is a critical tool for modern web design.

The Problem CSS Solves
----------------------

CSS is a critical technology for modern web design. By separating the
presentation layer from the content layer, CSS allows designers to create
consistent, flexible, and accessible websites that are easy to maintain and
update. With its wide range of styling options and advanced features, CSS
is an essential tool for creating engaging and effective websites.

Web development is a complex process that involves many different
technologies and tools. One of the most important technologies for web
development is CSS, which is a stylesheet language that is used to define
the visual appearance of web pages. CSS solves several common problems
that web developers face when creating websites.

• Consistency across pages: One of the biggest challenges in web development is maintaining consistency across multiple pages. With CSS, 
developers can create a set of styles that can be applied to all pages on a website, ensuring a consistent look and feel. This makes it easier 
for users to navigate the website and helps to establish a strong brand identity.

• Responsive design: Another common problem in web development is creating websites that are optimized for different screen sizes and devices. 
CSS provides a range of tools and techniques for creating responsive designs, including media queries, flexible layouts, and viewport units. With 
these tools, developers can create websites that look great on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, without having to create separate
designs for each device.

• Browser compatibility: One of the most challenging aspects of web development is ensuring that websites look and function correctly across 
different web browsers. CSS provides a standardized way of defining styles, which helps to ensure that websites look consistent across different 
browsers. Additionally, CSS provides fallback options for older browsers so that websites can still be viewed by users who may not have
the latest software.

• Separation of content and presentation: One of the key principles of web development is the separation of content and presentation. CSS allows 
developers to create a clear separation between the content of a website and its visual appearance. This separation makes it easier to update the 
design of a website without affecting the underlying content and makes it easier to maintain and update the website over time.

• Accessibility: Accessibility is an important consideration in web development, as websites should be designed to be accessible to all users, 
including those with disabilities. CSS provides a range of tools and techniques for improving the accessibility of websites, such as using 
high-contrast colors, providing text alternatives for images, and using semantic HTML markup.

CSS is an essential technology for web development, as it solves many
of the common problems that developers face when creating websites. CSS
provides tools and techniques for maintaining consistency across pages,
creating responsive designs, ensuring browser compatibility, separating
content and presentation, and improving accessibility. With CSS,
developers can create engaging and effective websites that are optimized
for a wide range of users and devices.

CSS Selectors
-------------

CSS selectors are a powerful feature of Cascading Style Sheets that allow
developers to target specific elements on a web page and apply styles to
them. CSS selectors make it possible to create unique and complex styles
for different elements and are an essential tool for creating effective and
engaging web designs. In this section, we will explore the basics of CSS
selectors and how they work.

CSS selectors are used to target specific elements on a web page, such
as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Selectors can be used to apply
styles to individual elements or to groups of elements. There are several
types of CSS selectors; each has its own syntax and functionality.

• Type selectors: Type selectors target elements based on their HTML tag name. For example, the selector h1 would target all heading level 1 
elements on the page. Type selectors are the simplest type of selector and are often used to apply global styles to all elements of a particular 
type.

• Class selectors: Class selectors target elements based on their class attribute. The class attribute is used to assign a name to an element, 
which can then be targeted with a selector. For example, the selector .my-class would target all elements that have the class my-class assigned 
to them. Class selectors are often used to apply styles to specific groups of elements, such as navigation menus or buttons.

• ID selectors: ID selectors target elements based on their ID attribute. The ID attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an element, 
which can then be targeted with a selector. For example, the selector #my-id would target the element that has the ID my-id assigned to it. ID 
selectors are often used to apply styles to specific elements, such as headers or footer sections.

• Attribute selectors: Attribute selectors target elements based on their attributes, such as the src attribute for images or the href attribute 
for links. Attribute selectors can be used to target elements based on specific attribute values or to target elements that have a particular 
attribute assigned to them.

• Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements: Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are used to target elements based on their state or position within the 
document. Pseudo-classes are used to target elements based on user interactions, such as hovering over a link or clicking a button. 
Pseudo-elements are used to target specific parts of an element, such as the first letter of a paragraph or the content of a link.

CSS selectors are an essential tool for web developers, as they allow
for precise targeting of specific elements on a web page. By using a
combination of type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute
selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements, developers can
create unique and complex styles for different elements on a web page.
Understanding CSS selectors is a fundamental aspect of web development
and is essential for creating effective and engaging web designs. All these
selectors will be covered as part of later chapters.

Summary
-------

This chapter covered the technologies used in web development. It
also covered how HTML is rendered by a browser and its DOM tree, the
different HTML elements, and the way it is being displayed by the browser
using pseudo-code. It covered HTML page structure and how it can be
defined in multiple ways. We also looked at how CSS works along with
HTML and what kinds of problems can be solved using CSS and different
CSS selectors.
