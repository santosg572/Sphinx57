GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see GitHubâ€™s plans.

GitHub Pages now uses GitHub Actions to execute the Jekyll build. When using a branch as the source of your build, GitHub Actions must be enabled in your repository if you want to use the built-in Jekyll workflow. Alternatively, if GitHub Actions is unavailable or disabled, adding a .nojekyll file to the root of your source branch will bypass the Jekyll build process and deploy the content directly. For more information on enabling GitHub Actions, see Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository.

Organization owners can restrict the publication of GitHub Pages sites from repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see Managing the publication of GitHub Pages sites for your organization.

Creating a repository for your site

You can either create a repository or choose an existing repository for your site.

If you want to create a GitHub Pages site for a repository where not all of the files in the repository are related to the site, you will be able to configure a publishing source for your site. For example, you can have a dedicated branch and folder to hold your site source files, or you can use a custom GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy your site source files.

If the account that owns the repository uses GitHub Free or GitHub Free for organizations, the repository must be public.

If you want to create a site in an existing repository, skip to the Creating your site section.

    In the upper-right corner of any page, select 

, then click New repository.

Use the Owner dropdown menu to select the account you want to own the repository. 

Type a name for your repository and an optional description. If you're creating a user or organization site, your repository must be named <user>.github.io or <organization>.github.io. If your user or organization name contains uppercase letters, you must lowercase the letters. For more information, see What is GitHub Pages?. 



Choose a repository visibility. For more information, see About repositories.

Select Initialize this repository with a README.

Click Create repository.


Creating your site

Before you can create your site, you must have a repository for your site on GitHub. If you're not creating your site in an existing repository, see Creating a repository for your site.

Warning

GitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if the repository for the site is private (if your plan or organization allows it). If you have sensitive data in your site's repository, you may want to remove the data before publishing. For more information, see About repositories.

    On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.

    Decide which publishing source you want to use. See Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site.

    Create the entry file for your site. GitHub Pages will look for an index.html, index.md, or README.md file as the entry file for your site.

If your publishing source is a branch and folder, the entry file must be at the top level of the source folder on the source branch. For example, if your publishing source is the /docs folder on the main branch, your entry file must be located in the /docs folder on a branch called main.

If your publishing source is a GitHub Actions workflow, the artifact that you deploy must include the entry file at the top level of the artifact. Instead of adding the entry file to your repository, you may choose to have your GitHub Actions workflow generate your entry file when the workflow runs.



Configure your publishing source. See Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site.

Your GitHub Pages site is built and deployed with a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information, see Viewing workflow run history.

Note

GitHub Actions is free for public repositories. Usage charges apply for private and internal repositories that go beyond the monthly allotment of free minutes. For more information, see Usage limits, billing, and administration.
