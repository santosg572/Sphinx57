<h1>CHAPTER 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-3-cascading-style-sheets-and-layouts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This chapter covers CSS and layouts. This chapter will explain how to
create and use floats in CSS3, as well as explaining the issues faced when
working with floats and how to resolve them. Next, the chapter will cover
box-sizing versus border-box, which one to use, and how to resolve issues
if there are any during implementing them. Then, the chapter will explain
how to implement a flexbox layout using CSS3, by providing HTML and
CSS code and showing how the browser renders this code. It will explain
various attributes and their values as well as how to arrange flex items
and what properties they can have. The CSS grid layout is the next topic,
covering details such as aligning and spacing grid items and sizing each
item in the layout.</p>

<h2>CSS and Responsive Design<a class="headerlink" href="#css-and-responsive-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an essential tool for web developers to
create visually appealing websites. With the release of CSS3, developers
have gained access to a plethora of new features that make designing
websites much easier and more efficient. One of the most significant
improvements in CSS3 is the ability to create complex and dynamic layouts
without the need for external libraries or frameworks. In this chapter, we
will explore three ways to build layouts using CSS3.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Flexbox</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A flexbox is a powerful model that enables
developers to design responsive and dynamic
layouts quickly. A flexbox works by defining a
container and its child elements, which are referred
to as flex items. With a flexbox, you can easily align
and distribute items within a container, adjust
their sizes, and reorder them without affecting the
HTML structure. The display property of the parent
element is set to flex, and the layout properties
for the child elements are defined to create a flex
container. The most commonly used properties
in a flexbox are justify-content, align-items, and
flex-wrap.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Grid</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A CSS grid is another powerful layout model that
enables developers to create complex layouts
with ease. With a CSS grid, you can define a grid
container, divide it into rows and columns, and
then place elements anywhere within that grid.
A grid offers much more control over positioning
than a flexbox and is particularly useful for creating
multicolumn layouts. To use a grid, you need to
define a grid container and specify its properties,
such as grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows,
and grid-gap. Once the grid container is defined, the
grid-column and grid-row attributes can be used to
place the items inside the grid.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Floats</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Floats are a legacy technique for creating layouts
still widely used today. Floats work by “floating” an
element to one side of its container, allowing other
content to flow around it. This technique is useful
for creating multicolumn layouts and wrapping text
around images. To use floats, you need to set the
float attribute of an element to either left or right
and then specify the width and margin properties
to control its positioning. While floats can be useful
for simple layouts, they have limitations and are not
recommended for complex designs.</p>
<p>CSS3 offers developers a range of powerful tools for creating dynamic
and responsive layouts. Flexbox and grid are the most commonly used
layout models and offer a lot of flexibility and control over positioning.
Floats are still useful for simple layouts but should be avoided for complex
designs. By mastering these three techniques, developers can create
visually appealing and responsive websites that work across multiple
devices and platforms.</p>

<h2>Using Floats<a class="headerlink" href="#using-floats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CSS3 float property allows you to position an element to the left or
right of its containing parent block, allowing other elements to flow around
it. What float does is take out the element from its normal document flow
and position it in relation to its parent element.</p>

<p>This code example has a parent container &lt;div&gt; with two child &lt;div&gt;s;
the first one is floated to the left, and the second one is floated to the
right. We also have a paragraph element after the floated &lt;div&gt;s that flows
around them.</p>
<p>The .left and .right classes specify the float property, as well as the
width, background color, padding, and margin properties. The .container
class specifies the width, margin, background color, and padding
properties.</p>
<p>Note that when using floats, it is important to clear them afterward to
prevent unexpected layout behavior. This can be done by using the clear
property or by using a clearfix hack.</p>

<p>When working with CSS floats, it’s common to encounter issues where
floated elements do not behave as expected, such as when the containing
element doesn’t expand to contain its floated children or when subsequent
elements are unintentionally affected by the float.</p>
<p>CSS clearfix will come to rescue to fix this problem, which is a
technique to force a container element to expand and contain its floated
children. Let’s look at an example of how to use a clearfix.</p>
<p>Here is some code without the clearfix:</p>

clearfix</p>
<p>In this example, the .container class now has an :after pseudo-element
with the content property value set to a blank string, display property set to
table, and clear property set to both. This creates a pseudo-element after
the container element and clears any floated elements within it, forcing the
container to expand and contain its floated children.</p>
<p>Note that the clearfix technique can be applied to any container
element with floated children and can also be achieved using other
methods such as using the overflow property or using a separate element
with the clear property.</p>

Box-Sizing or Border-Box
An element’s box-model size can be controlled by the box-sizing property
in CSS. By default, the size of an element is calculated based on its
content, padding, border, and margin. However, with box-sizing, you can
change this behavior to calculate the size of an element based on different
box models.
There are two values for the box-sizing property: content-box and
border-box.
• content-box: This is the box-sizing property’s default
value. When box-sizing: content-box is applied to an
element, the element’s dimensions are calculated
based on its content, padding, and border. Any margin
applied to the element is added to its total width
and height.
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>75
• border-box: When box-sizing: border-box is applied to
an element, the element’s dimensions are calculated
based on its content, padding, border, and margin.
The total height and width of the element include its
padding and border, but not any margin applied to it.
When content-box is used, the width is the addition of widths of
content, margins, padding, and border as opposed to border-box, which is
adjusting its width of content to accommodate the margins, padding, and
border. Let’s look at some examples.
The CSS for main and nav are modified, and a new definition of
container is added.</p>
<p>When main or nav is modified with margin or padding with content-
box, look athow the browser is displaying the content. Also note that the</p>
<p>nav definition is using a box-sizing: content-box.

<p>Introduction to Flexboxes
CSS3 has brought a lot of exciting new features to the field of web
development, and one of the most powerful is the flexbox layout system. A</p>
<p>flexbox, which means “flexible box layout,” is a flexible and easy-to-
use system for laying out elements in a container. It allows you to control</p>
<p>the alignment, size, and distribution of elements with just a few simple
properties, making it an essential tool for creating modern, responsive web
designs.
One of the key benefits of a flexbox is its simplicity. With just a few lines
of CSS, you can create complex and flexible layouts that would be difficult
or impossible with traditional CSS layout techniques. To create a flexbox,
a container element that encapsulates all the elements you want to lay out
needs to be created. By changing the display property value to flex (display:
flex), any HTML element can be turned into a flex container; let that HTML
element be a &lt;div&gt; or a section.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>80
Once you have your container set up, you can start using the various
flexbox properties to control the layout of the elements inside it. Some
of the most important properties include flex-direction, justify-content,
align-items, and flex-wrap.
• flex-direction is used to determine two things: the main
axis of the flex container and the direction in which the
flex items are organized. It can be set to row, which is
the default, to organize the items in a row from left to
right. Alternatively, you can set it to row-reverse to lay
out the items from right to left or column-reverse to lay</p>
<p>them out in a column from top to bottom. column-
reverse can also be used to lay out the items from</p>
<p>bottom to top.
• justify-content controls how the items are aligned
along the main axis of the flex container. It can be set
to a number of different values, including flex-start,
flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, and
space-evenly. flex-start aligns the items to the start
of the container, flex-end aligns them to the end, and
center aligns them to the center. space-between is used
when items need to be aligned with equal space in
between them along the main axis, while space-around
distributes the items with equal space on their left and
right sides. Finally, space-evenly distributes the items
with equal space between and around them.
• align-items controls how the flex items are organized
along the cross-axis of the container, which is
perpendicular to the main axis. By default the value is</p>
<p>stretch, which stretches the items to fill the entire cross-
axis. Alternatively, you can set it to flex-start to align</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>them to the start of the cross-axis, flex-end to align
them to the end, center to align them to the center, or
baseline to align them to the baseline of the text.
• flex-wrap controls if the flex items should wrap to the
next line or stay on the same line. The default value
is set to nowrap, which means that the items will stay
on the same line and may overflow the container.
However, this value can be set to wrap that permits the
items to wrap to the next line as needed. wrap-reverse
can also be used to wrap the items to the next line in
reverse order.
• Finally, flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis control the</p>
<p>size and flexibility of the individual flex items. flex-
grow determines the growth of an item in relation to</p>
<p>other items in the container, flex-shrink determines the
factory by which an item can shrink, and flex-basis is
used to set the initial size of the flex items before any
remaining space.</p>
<p>Flexbox Overview
CSS has revolutionized the way web pages are designed and structured.
One of the most powerful CSS features is the flexbox, a layout model that
lets developers create flexible and responsive designs with ease. Whether
you’re an experienced web developer or just a beginner, understanding
the fundamentals of a flexbox is essential for building modern, dynamic
web interfaces. In this section, we will provide an overview of a flexbox,
exploring its core concepts and demonstrating how it can streamline your
CSS layouts.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>82
What is a flexbox? A flexbox, short for “flexible box layout,” is a
CSS layout model designed to provide a way to create a container that
effectively arranges, distributes, and aligns the elements within it. With
Flexbox, you can create responsive and dynamic layouts that adapt to
different screen sizes and orientations.
• The flex container and flex items: To use a flexbox, a flex
container and its children known as flex items must be
defined. The value flex for the display attribute (display:
flex) creates a flex container and enables flexbox
properties for its child elements. This allows you to
control the layout and positioning of the child elements
known as flex items within the container.
• Main axis and cross axis: The flexbox layout introduces
two main axes: the main axis and the cross axis. The
primary axis along which the flex items are aligned is
the main axis, while the cross axis runs vertically to it.
The direction of the main axis can be defined using the</p>
<p>flex-direction property, which can be set to row, row-
reverse, column, or column-reverse. This flexibility</p>
<p>enables both horizontal and vertical layouts.
• Alignment and distribution: Flexbox provides a
powerful mechanism to arrange and spread flex items
along the main axes as well as cross axes. Some of the
key properties include the following:
• justify-content: How flex items are aligned along the
main axes is controlled by justify-content.
• align-items: This aligns flex items along the
cross axis.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>83</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>align-content: This provides an additional space</p></li>
</ul>
<p>along the cross axis when multiple rows or columns
of flex items need to be accommodated in the
container.
• Flex item properties: Flex items have properties that
allow you to control their behavior within the flex
container. Some commonly used properties include the
following:
• flex-grow: This specifies how flex items will spread
to fill available space.
• flex-shrink: This determines the ability of flex items
to shrink when space is limited.
• flex-basis: The initial size of a flex item is defined
first, and the remaining space is distributed across
the flex items within the container.
• order: This controls the order in which flex items
appear within the container.
• Responsive layouts with Flexbox: Flexbox excels at
creating responsive layouts that adapt to different
screen sizes and orientations. By combining flexible
sizing options, media queries, and other CSS
techniques, you can build dynamic interfaces that
seamlessly adjust to varying devices and viewport
dimensions.
• Browser pupport and compatibility: A flexbox is widely
supported in modern browsers, including Chrome,
Firefox, Safari, and Edge. However, for older versions of
Internet Explorer, partial support is available using
the -ms- prefix.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>84
A flexbox is a powerful CSS layout model that enables developers
with a versatile toolset to create flexible and responsive web designs. By
understanding the core concepts of a flexbox and its various properties,
you can streamline your CSS layouts and build modern interfaces that
adapt seamlessly to different devices. With its widespread browser
support, a flexbox is a valuable addition to any developer’s toolkit. So, dive
into the world of flexbox and take your web layouts to new heights!
Arranging the Flex Items
In CSS3, you can use a flexbox layout to align and space flex items within
a flex container. A flexbox provides several properties that control the flex
items’ space and alignment within the container. Let’s go through the main
properties you can use:
• Justify content: The alignment of the flex items along
the main axis of the container is controlled by the
justify content property. It defines how the extra space
is spread between and around flex items. The following
are the possible values:
• flex-start: Items are aligned at the start of the
container.
• flex-end: Items are aligned at the end of the
container.
• center: Items are centered within the container.
• space-between: Items are evenly spread with space
between them.
• space-around: The space around the flex items is
distributed evenly.
• space-evenly: The flex items will be aligned by
spacing them evenly in the container.
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>85</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Align items: The alignment of the flex items along</p></li>
</ul>
<p>the cross axis of the container is controlled by align
items property. It determines how items are aligned
within their respective lines. The possible values are as
follows:
• flex-start: Items are aligned at the start of the
cross axis.
• flex-end: Items are aligned at the end of the
cross axis.
• center: Items are centered along the cross axis.
• stretch: Items are stretched to fill the container
along the cross axis.
• baseline: Flex items’ baseline will determine their
alignment.
• Align self: The only difference between align-items
and align-self is that align-self allows flex items to be
aligned individually within the container. It takes the
same values as align-items.
• Align content: Multiple lines of flex items can be
arranged along the cross axis by using this property, in
case they wrap into multiple lines. The possible values
are similar to justify-content but apply to the cross axis.
• Flex item margins: You can also use regular CSS margin
properties to add space around individual flex items.
An alternate to this is gap, which can be applied to flex
container and will do the same job as margins.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>86
• Order: All the flex elements are of order 0 and displayed
in the same order as defined in the HTML. If you want
to re-order the elements, the order property can be
given a value to less than 0 to move the flex item ahead
or greater than 0 to move the flex item after the flex
item having the default order.
Here’s the code for style.css:
.container {
font-family: sans-serif;
background-color: bisque;
font-size: 34px;
/* Flexbox <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>/
display: flex;

Properties of Flex
In CSS, the flex property is a shorthand property that combines three
individual properties: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. It is used to
control the behavior and sizing of flex items within a flex container.
The flex property accepts up to three values.
• flex-grow: It is possible for one flex item to grow
in comparison to other flex items within the same
container. How much it will grow can be determined by
the flex-grow property. It takes a non-negative number
as a value. By default, all flex items have a flex-grow
value of 0, which means they won’t grow to fill the
available space. If you set a positive value, such as flex:
1, the item will grow proportionally to other items with
positive flex-grow values.
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>89</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>flex-shrink: It is possible for one flex item to shrink</p></li>
</ul>
<p>in comparison to other flex items within the same
container. How much it will shrink can be determined
by the flex-shrink property. It takes a non-negative</p>
<p>number as a value. By default, all flex items have a flex-
shrink value of 1, which means they can shrink equally.</p>
<p>If you set a value of 0, the item will not shrink. If you set
a higher value, such as flex: 2, the item will shrink twice
as much as other items with flex-shrink set to 1.
• flex-basis: The initial size of the flex items can be
defined by this property after the remaining space is
distributed. It can be specified as a length value (e.g.,
pixels, percentages) or the keyword auto. The default
value is auto, which means the item’s size is based on
its content or the value of its width or height properties.
You can also use flex-basis to explicitly set a specific
size for the flex item.
Here are a few examples of how the flex property can be used:
.flex-item {
flex: 1; /* Equivalent to flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1,
flex-basis: 0 <em>/
}
.flex-item {
flex: 0 0 200px; /</em> No growth, no shrinking, initial width
of 200 pixels <em>/
}
.flex-item {
flex: 2 1 auto; /</em> Twice the growth compared to other
items, default shrinking, initial size based on content <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">*</span></a>/
}</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>90
By utilizing the flex property, you have control over how flex items
grow, shrink, and establish their initial size within a flex container.

The flex container has three flex items in the previous code example.
The display property converts the normal container into a flex container.
The justify-content property is set to space-between, which places an
equal space between the items. The align-items property is set to center,
which vertically centers the items within the container.
The .item class has a flex property set to 1, which allows the items
to grow and shrink equally to fill the available space. We also add some
padding and styling to make the items visually distinguishable.
You can customize the layout by adjusting the flex properties and other
CSS properties to meet your specific needs. Feel free to modify the code as
desired.

<p>Introduction to CSS Grid
The CSS grid is a powerful layout system introduced in CSS3 that allows
developers to create complex and responsive grid-based layouts on web
pages. It provides a wide range of features and properties that enable
precise control over placing and aligning flex items within a grid.
Before CSS grids, web developers relied on various techniques such
as floats, positioning, and flexboxes to achieve grid-like layouts. While
these techniques were useful, they often required complex CSS rules and
were not specifically designed for creating grid layouts. CSS grid, on the
other hand, was built from the ground up to address these limitations and
provide a more intuitive and efficient way to create grid-based designs.
The main concept behind a CSS grid is the division of a web page into
a series of rows and columns. Elements within these rows and columns
can be placed and arranged according to the desired layout. The grid
container serves as the parent element that holds the grid items, which are
the individual elements being positioned within the grid.
To start using the CSS grid layout, you first define a grid container by
applying the display: grid property to a parent element. This establishes
the grid context for its child elements. Once the grid container is set, you</p>
<p>can specify the size and behavior of the rows and columns using the grid-
template-rows and grid-template-columns properties. These properties</p>
<p>allow you to define fixed sizes, use flexible proportions, or even use
keywords like auto to automatically adjust the size based on the content.</p>
<p>Elements within the grid container can be positioned using the grid-
row and grid-column properties. These properties determine the starting</p>
<p>and ending positions of an element within the grid, allowing you to create
both simple and complex layouts. Additionally, the row and column
positions can be defined by the grid-area property in a single declaration.
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>94
The CSS grid also offers powerful alignment and spacing options. You
can align elements vertically or horizontally within their respective grid
cells using properties such as justify-items, align-items, justify-content,
and align-content. These properties enable precise control over the
positioning of grid items. Furthermore, the grid-gap property allows you
to define the spacing between rows and columns, providing flexibility in
adjusting the overall grid layout.
One of the most powerful features of a CSS grid is its ability to handle</p>
<p>responsive design seamlessly. By utilizing media queries and the grid-
template-areas property, you can create different grid layouts for different</p>
<p>screen sizes. This flexibility makes it easier to build responsive websites
that adapt to various devices and screen resolutions.
The CSS grid is a game-changer for web layout design. With its intuitive
syntax and powerful capabilities, it simplifies the creation of grid-based
layouts, offers precise control over element positioning and alignment,
and enables seamless responsiveness. Whether you are a beginner or an
experienced developer, mastering the CSS grid layout opens up a world of
possibilities for creating modern and visually appealing web designs. So,
dive into CSS grid and elevate your web layout skills to the next level!</p>
<p>CSS Grid: Revolutionizing Web
Layout Design
The CSS grid layout system has revolutionalized the way web developers
create and manage website layouts. With its introduction in CSS3, the CSS</p>
<p>grid provides a powerful and flexible solution for designing complex grid-
based structures with ease. In this section, we will explore the fundamental</p>
<p>concepts and features of CSS grid and understand how it has reshaped the
landscape of web design.
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>What Is a CSS Grid?
A CSS grid is a two-dimensional layout model that allows developers to
create grid-based designs by dividing a web page into rows and columns.
Unlike previous layout methods such as floats and positioning, a CSS
grid provides a dedicated system designed specifically for building grids,
making it more intuitive and efficient.
Defining a Grid
To start using a CSS grid, we designate an element as the grid container
by applying the display: grid property. This establishes the grid context
for its child elements, turning them into grid items. Once the container is
defined, we can set up the rows and columns by using properties such as
grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns, specifying their sizes and
proportions or using keywords like auto to dynamically adjust based on
content.
Placing Grid Items
A CSS grid offers accurate control over the placement of grid items within
the grid container. We can specify the starting and ending positions of an
item within the grid using properties such as grid-row-start, grid-row-end,
grid-column-start, and grid-column-end. These properties allow us to
create both simple and complex layouts by precisely positioning items in
the desired grid cells.
Grid Lines and Areas
Grid lines play a crucial role in a CSS grid as they define the boundaries
of rows and columns. By utilizing line-based placement, we can position
items not only within cells but also across multiple cells. Additionally, a
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>96
CSS grid introduces the concept of grid areas. With the grid-area property,
we can assign names to areas within the grid and easily position items in
those areas using the grid-area value.
Alignment and Spacing
A CSS grid provides powerful alignment and spacing options to control
the positioning of grid items. Properties such as justify-items, align-items,
justify-content, and align-content allow us to align items vertically and
horizontally within their grid cells or adjust the overall alignment of items
within the grid container. Moreover, the grid-gap property enables us to
define the spacing between rows and columns, allowing for precise control
over the layout’s spacing and rhythm.
Responsive Design with CSS Grid
One of the standout features of a CSS grid is its ability to handle responsive
design effortlessly. By combining media queries with different grid
configurations, developers can create different layouts for different screen
sizes. Using the grid-template-areas property, we can assign grid areas
to specific sections of the layout and rearrange them dynamically as the
screen size changes. This flexibility empowers us to build responsive
websites that seamlessly adapt to various devices and screen resolutions.
Browser Support
A CSS grid enjoys widespread browser support, making it accessible to
a vast majority of web users. All the latest browsers, including Google
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, have excellent support for CSS grids.
Additionally, with the use of vendor prefixes, developers can ensure
compatibility with older browser versions.
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>97
In conclusion, a CSS grid is a groundbreaking layout system that has
revolutionized web design. Its intuitive syntax, extensive features, and
excellent browser support make it a go-to choice for creating responsive,
flexible, and visually appealing grid-based layouts. By mastering CSS grids,
developers can unlock a new level of creativity and efficiency in web layout
design, enabling them to build modern, dynamic websites that engage and
delight users. So, embrace CSS grids and embark on an exciting journey to
reshape the digital landscape.
Sizing Grid Columns and Rows
The CSS grid layout has revolutionized web design by providing a powerful
and flexible way to create grid-based layouts. One of the key aspects of
CSS grids is the ability to size grid columns and rows according to our
design requirements. In this section, we will explore different methods and
techniques for sizing grid columns and rows effectively.
• Understanding the grid template: Before manipulating
sizing, it’s important to grasp the concept of the grid
template. The grid template defines the structure of the
grid by specifying the number of rows and columns it
should have. Here’s an example:
.grid-container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
grid-template-rows: auto 100px;
}
In this example, we have three columns with a
flexible width ratio of 1:2:1 and two rows, one with an
automatic height and the other with a fixed height of
100 pixels.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>98
• Using fixed sizes: To set fixed sizes for grid columns and
rows, we can use specific length units like pixels (px) or
any other appropriate unit. For instance:
.grid-container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 200px 300px;
grid-template-rows: 100px 150px;
}
The previous code example will create a grid with two
columns, the first being 200 pixels wide and the second
300 pixels wide. Similarly, the grid will have two rows,
with the first being 100 pixels tall and the second 150
pixels tall.
• Utilizing flexible sizes: CSS grids also provide a powerful
way to create flexible sizes for grid columns and rows.
This approach allows the grid to adjust its layout
dynamically based on available space. The fr unit is
used to define these flexible sizes. Here’s an example:
.grid-container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
grid-template-rows: 1fr auto;
}
In this case, the first column occupies one-third of the</p>
<p>grid’s width, while the second column occupies two-
thirds. The first row takes one-third of the grid’s height,</p>
<p>while the second row expands to fit its content.
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>99</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Combining fixed and flexible sizes: In many cases, a</p></li>
</ul>
<p>combination of fixed and flexible sizes is required
to achieve the desired layout. CSS Grid allows us to
mix these approaches within the grid template. For
example:
.grid-container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 200px 2fr;
grid-template-rows: auto 100px;
}
Here, the first column and the third column have flexible sizes that
adapt to the available space, while the middle column maintains a fixed
width of 200 pixels. The first row adjusts its height based on content, and
the second row has a fixed height of 100 pixels.
Sizing grid columns and rows in a CSS grid layout gives developers
fine-grained control over their web layouts. By combining fixed and</p>
<p>flexible sizes intelligently, we can create versatile and responsive grid-
based designs. Understanding the grid template and utilizing length units</p>
<p>like pixels and the fr unit empowers us to craft layouts that meet our design
goals. Experiment with different sizing techniques to achieve visually
appealing and adaptive grid layouts with a CSS grid.
Placing and Aligning Grid Items
To place and align grid items in a CSS grid layout, there are numerous
properties and values you can use various properties and values. Here’s an
overview of the most commonly used ones:</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>100
• grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows: These
properties define the size and number of columns and
rows in your grid. You can specify the size using absolute
units (pixels, percentages) or relative units (fr, auto).
Here’s an example:
.grid-container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
grid-template-rows: auto 100px;
}
• grid-column and grid-row: These properties specify the
starting and ending positions of an item within the grid
by referring to the column and row lines.
Here’s an example:
.grid-item {
grid-column: 2 / 4; /* Starts at the 2nd column
line and ends at the 4th column line <em>/
grid-row: 1; /</em> Starts at the 1st row line and ends
at the 1st row line (same row) <em>/
}
• grid-area: A single declaration that can declare the
item’s size and position is achieved using the grid-area
attribute by using the grid area’s name.
Here’s an example:
.grid-item {
grid-area: header; /</em> Refers to a named grid area
called “header” <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">*</span></a>/
}
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>101
• justify-self and align-self: The individual grid items can
be aligned using this attribute within their cells along
the horizontal (justify) and vertical (align) axes.
Here’s an example:
.grid-item {
justify-self: center; /* Centers the item
horizontally within its cell <em>/
align-self: end; /</em> Aligns the item to the bottom
of its cell <em>/
}
• justify-items and align-items: These properties set the
default alignment for all grid items within the grid
container.
Here’s an example:
.grid-container {
justify-items: center; /</em> Centers all items
horizontally within their cells <em>/
align-items: stretch; /</em> Stretches all items
vertically to fill their cells <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">*</span></a>/
}
These are just a few examples of how you can place and align grid
items in a CSS grid layout. By combining these properties and values,
you can create various grid layouts and achieve precise control over the
positioning and alignment of your elements.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>102
Building a CSS Grid Layout
CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that permits the creation of complex
and flexible grid-based designs. Let’s see an example of how you can create
a basic grid layout.
Here is style.css:
.grid-container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* Three columns with
equal width <em>/
grid-gap: 10px; /</em> Gap between grid items <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">*</span></a>/
}
.item {
background-color: #cd3434;
padding: 20px;
}
Here is grid.html:
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Float Layout Example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css”
href=”style.css”&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div class=”grid-container”&gt;
&lt;div class=”item”&gt;Item 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=”item”&gt;Item 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=”item”&gt;Item 3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=”item”&gt;Item 4&lt;/div&gt;
Chapter 3 Cascading Style Sheets and Layouts</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>&lt;div class=”item”&gt;Item 5&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=”item”&gt;Item 6&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>In the previous example, we have a container with the class grid-
container that displays as a grid. The grid-template-columns property</p>
<p>defines the number and width of the grid columns. In this case, we have
three columns, each with equal width (1fr).
The grid-gap property adds a gap of 10 pixels between grid items.
The item class is applied to each grid item. In this example, I’ve given
them a background color and some padding to make them visually distinct.
Feel free to adjust the number of columns, gap size, and styling as
per your requirements. You can also use different units such as pixels,
percentages, or auto for column widths to create more complex grid
layouts.

CHAPTER 4</p>
<p>Media Queries</p>
<p>In the era of smartphones, tablets, and multitudes of screen sizes, creating
a seamless user experience across devices has become crucial. Responsive
web design allows websites to adapt and respond to different viewport
sizes, providing optimal viewing experiences. CSS3 introduced a powerful
feature called media queries that enables developers to tailor stylesheets
based on various device characteristics. In this chapter, we will explore
what media queries are, how they work, and their significance in creating
responsive designs.</p>
<p>What Are Media Queries?
Media queries are a CSS3 feature that allows developers to apply
different stylesheets or specific styles within a stylesheet based on the
characteristics of the device or viewport. These characteristics include
viewport width, height, device type, orientation, resolution, and more. By
utilizing media queries, developers can create designs that adapt gracefully
to different devices and ensure the content remains readable and usable
across various screen sizes.</p>
<p>106
Media queries work by evaluating the media features specified within
the query and applying the associated styles if the conditions are met.
The general syntax of a media query consists of an &#64;media rule followed
by one or more media features enclosed within parentheses. Here’s an
example of a basic media query:
&#64;media (max-width: 768px) {
/* Styles to apply when viewport width is 768px or less <a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">*</span></a>/
}
In this example, the styles within the curly braces will be applied when
the viewport width is 768 pixels or less. Media queries can also include
logical operators such as and, not, and only to combine multiple media
features for precise targeting.</p>
<p>Common Media Features
Here are the common media features:
• Width and height: The width and height media features
allow developers to apply styles based on the viewport
dimensions. For example:
&#64;media (max-width: 600px) {
/* Styles for viewport width 600px or less <em>/
}
&#64;media (min-height: 768px) {
/</em> Styles for viewport height 768px or more <a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">*</span></a>/
}
Chapter 4 Media Queries</p>
<p>107</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Device type: Media queries can also target specific</p></li>
</ul>
<p>device types, such as the screen, print, speech, and
more. This allows for tailored styles for different output
devices. For example:
&#64;media screen {
/* Styles for screen devices <em>/
}
&#64;media print {
/</em> Styles for print media <em>/
}
• Orientation: The orientation media feature enables
developers to differentiate between portrait and
landscape orientations of the device. For example:
&#64;media (orientation: landscape) {
/</em> Styles for landscape orientation <em>/
}
&#64;media (orientation: portrait) {
/</em> Styles for portrait orientation <em>/
}
• Resolution: Media queries can target devices based
on their display resolution, ensuring high-resolution
assets are used when necessary. For example:
&#64;media (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
/</em> Styles for devices with high-resolution
displays <a href="#id17"><span class="problematic" id="id18">*</span></a>/
}</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Media Queries</p>
<p>108
Significance of Media Queries
Media queries are integral to creating responsive web designs that adapt
to the ever-expanding range of devices and screen sizes. They allow
developers to craft interfaces that provide a consistent user experience,
regardless of whether the user is on a desktop, smartphone, or tablet.
By utilizing media queries effectively, websites can improve readability,
usability, and overall user satisfaction.
Media queries in CSS3 empower developers to build responsive
web designs that gracefully adapt to various devices and screen sizes. By
targeting specific media features, such as width, height, orientation, and
resolution, developers can apply custom styles to ensure a seamless user
experience. With the continued growth of mobile and diverse screen sizes,
understanding and implementing media queries is essential for creating
modern, user-friendly websites that cater to a wide range of devices and
user preferences.</p>
<p>How Does a Media Query Work?
This section covers how to define a media query. Consider the following
CSS code.
Here is style.css:
.container {
background-color: cadetblue;
width: 1920px;
height: 1080px;
clear: both;
}
Chapter 4 Media Queries</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>&#64;media screen and (max-width : 920px) {
.container {
background-color: crimson;
clear: both;
}
}
&#64;media screen and (max-width : 780px) {
.container {
background-color: plum;
clear: both;
}
}
&#64;media screen and (max-width : 600px) {
.container {
background-color: darkgreen;
clear: both;
}
}
&#64;media screen and (max-width : 360px) {
.container {
background-color: seagreen;
clear: both;
}
}</p>

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div class=”container”&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
How does Google Chrome display this with different resolution sizes?
