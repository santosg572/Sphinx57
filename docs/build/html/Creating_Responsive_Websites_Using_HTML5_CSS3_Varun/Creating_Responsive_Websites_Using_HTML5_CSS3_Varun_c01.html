<section id="how-html-works-in-a-web-browser">
<h2>How HTML Works in a Web Browser<a class="headerlink" href="#how-html-works-in-a-web-browser" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>HTML is the backbone of the modern Web. It is the standard markup
language used to create web pages, and it provides a way for developers
to structure content and define its meaning. However, HTML doesn’t
work exactly the same way on all web browsers, and understanding these
differences is crucial for building websites that work well across different
platforms.</p>
<p>Web browsers are software applications that retrieve and display web
pages from the Internet. There are several popular web browsers available
today, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and
Microsoft Edge; older browsers include Opera and Netscape Navigator.
Each browser has its own rendering engine, which is responsible for
interpreting and displaying HTML code.
Figure 1-1 shows some HTML code.</p>
<p>Figure 1-1. Hello world HTML code</p>
<p>The rendering engine is the part of the browser that takes the HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript code and turns it into a visual representation on the
screen. It parses the HTML and constructs a document object model
(DOM), which is a treelike structure that represents the content and
structure of the web page (Figure 1-2). The rendering engine then uses the
DOM and CSS to determine how the web page should be displayed.</p>
<p>Figure 1-2. DOM tree for the HTML code</p>
<p>Different browsers have different rendering engines, which can lead to
variations in how web pages are displayed. For example, some browsers
may handle HTML and CSS in slightly different ways, leading to differences
in layout and formatting. Additionally, different browsers may support
different HTML features, which can impact how certain elements of a web
page are displayed.</p>
<p>To ensure that web pages work well across different browsers,
developers need to be aware of these differences and test their pages on
multiple platforms. They can also use tools such as browser compatibility
checkers to identify any issues that may arise when viewing their pages on
different browsers.</p>
<p>In general, modern web browsers have good support for HTML5,
which is the latest version of the HTML standard. This means developers
can use the latest HTML features to create dynamic, interactive web pages
that work well across different platforms.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, however, there are still some differences in
how HTML is interpreted and displayed across different browsers. These
differences can be minor or significant, depending on the complexity of
the web page and the specific features being used.</p>
<p>To overcome these differences, web developers can use a technique
called browser sniffing, which involves detecting the specific browser
being used and tailoring the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code accordingly.
However, this technique can be complex and may not always be reliable,
so it’s important for developers to stay up-to-date with the latest web
standards and best practices.</p>

<section id="html-elements">
<h2>HTML Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#html-elements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages, and they define
the structure and content of the page. Each HTML element is surrounded
by opening and closing tags, which tell the browser how to display the
content. Though almost all of the tags have opening and closing tags, e.g.,
&lt;tag_name&gt;&lt;/tag_name&gt;, some tags have just the opening tag like &lt;img&gt;,
&lt;hr/&gt;, etc. We are going to take a look at various HTML elements that are
used to create web pages.</p>
<p>HTML elements can be categorized into several groups based on
their function. Some of the most common categories include structural
elements, text elements, multimedia elements, form elements, and
scripting elements.</p>
</section>
<section id="structural-elements">
<h2>Structural Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#structural-elements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Structural elements are used to define the overall structure of the web page.
They include elements such as the &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;
tags. The &lt;html&gt; tag is used to define the document type, while the &lt;head&gt;
tag contains information about the document, such as the title, author, and
description. The &lt;body&gt; tag contains the main content of the web page.</p>
</section>
<section id="text-elements">
<h2>Text Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#text-elements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Text elements are used to add text content to the web page. They include
elements such as the &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;–&lt;h6&gt;, and &lt;em&gt; tags. The &lt;p&gt; tag is used
to create paragraphs, while the &lt;h1&gt;–&lt;h6&gt; tags are used to create headings
of different sizes. The &lt;em&gt; tag is used to emphasize text, while the
&lt;strong&gt; tag is used to highlight important text.
Here is an example of a heading tag:</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
   <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>This text is Heading 1.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>This text is Heading 2.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h3</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>This text is Heading 3.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h3</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h4</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>This text is Heading 4.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h4</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h5</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>This text is Heading 5.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h5</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h6</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>This text is Heading 6.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h6</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
   <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Figure 1-3 shows an HTML file containing heading tag elements.</p>

<p>Here is a code example of &lt;p&gt;:</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
   <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
           This paragraph is written inside <span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>p<span class="ni">&amp;gt;</span> element.
           It will be displayed as continous text in the
           browser.
           Let us see how does it look on the browser.
      <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
   <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<section id="multimedia-elements">
<h2>Multimedia Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#multimedia-elements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Multimedia elements are used to add multimedia content to the web page,
such as images and videos. They include elements such as the &lt;img&gt; and
&lt;video&gt; tags. The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to display images, while the &lt;video&gt;
tag is used to display videos.
Here is a code example for &lt;img&gt;:</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<section id="form-elements">
<h2>Form Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#form-elements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Form elements are used to create forms on the web page, which allow
users to input information. They include elements such as the &lt;form&gt;,
&lt;input&gt;, and &lt;button&gt; tags. The &lt;form&gt; tag is used to create the form,
while the &lt;input&gt; tag is used to create input fields for the user to enter
information. The &lt;button&gt; tag is used to create buttons that the user can
click to submit the form. We are going to take a deeper look at the form
elements later in this book.</p>
</section>
<section id="scripting-elements">
<h2>Scripting Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#scripting-elements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Scripting elements are used to add interactivity to the web page, such as
animations and user interface elements. They include elements such as
the &lt;script&gt; and &lt;canvas&gt; tags. The &lt;script&gt; tag is used to add JavaScript
code to the web page, while the &lt;canvas&gt; tag is used to create graphics and
animations. We will learn about scripts and animation in later chapters.</p>
<p>In addition to these categories, there are many other HTML elements
that can be used to create web pages. Some of these elements are used
for more specialized purposes, such as the &lt;audio&gt; tag for playing audio
files or the &lt;iframe&gt; tag for embedding external web pages within the
current page.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that HTML elements are not the only component
of a web page. Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript are also used to
define the visual appearance and interactivity of the page, respectively.
However, HTML elements provide the foundation for the page and define
its overall structure and content.</p>
<p>In conclusion, HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages.
They define the structure and content of the page, and they are used to
create everything from text to multimedia to forms and interactivity. By
understanding the different types of HTML elements and how they are
used, web developers can create rich and engaging web pages that are easy
to navigate and interact with.</p>

<section id="html-page-structure">
<h2>HTML Page Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#html-page-structure" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>An HTML page structure is composed of several different elements, each
with its own purpose and function.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-basic-structure-of-an-html-page">
<h2>The Basic Structure of an HTML Page<a class="headerlink" href="#the-basic-structure-of-an-html-page" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>An HTML page consists of several different parts, including the doctype,
the head, and the body. The doctype is the first element in the page and
tells the browser what version of HTML is being used. The head element
contains information about the page that is not displayed to the user,
such as the page title, meta tags, and links to external resources. The body
element contains the main content of the page, including text, images, and
other multimedia elements.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each of the HTML page structure elements
and their role in the page:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; element is the first element in an HTML page and tells the browser what version of HTML is being used. The</p></li>
</ul>
<p>latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for HTML5 is simply &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>&lt;html&gt;: The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element of an HTML page and is used to define the entire structure of the page. It contains all the</p></li>
</ul>
<p>other elements of the page, including the head and body elements.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>&lt;head&gt;: The &lt;head&gt; element is used to provide information about the page that is not displayed to the user, such as the page title, meta tags,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>and links to external resources. The content within the head element is not visible to the user and is used by the browser to display the page
correctly.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>&lt;title&gt;: The &lt;title&gt; element is used to define the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser’s title bar and can also be used by</p></li>
</ul>
<p>search engines to display the page title in search results.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>&lt;meta&gt;: The &lt;meta&gt; element is used to provide additional information about the page, such as the page description, author, and keywords. These</p></li>
</ul>
<p>meta tags are used by search engines to help rank the page in search results.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>&lt;link&gt;: The &lt;link&gt; element is used to link to external resources, such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, or other HTML pages.</p></li>
<li><p>&lt;body&gt;: The &lt;body&gt; element contains the main content of the page, including text, images, and other multimedia elements. It is the visible part</p></li>
</ul>
<p>of the page that the user interacts with.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>&lt;header&gt;: The &lt;header&gt; element is used to define the header section of the page, which typically contains the site logo, navigation menu, and</p></li>
</ul>
<p>other header content.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>&lt;main&gt;: The &lt;main&gt; element is used to define the main content section of the page, which contains the primary content of the page.</p></li>
<li><p>&lt;footer&gt;: The &lt;footer&gt; element is used to define the footer section of the page, which typically contains copyright information, contact</p></li>
</ul>
<p>information, and other footer content.</p>
<p>The HTML page structure is composed of several different elements,
each with its own purpose and function. By understanding the basic
structure of an HTML page and the role of each element, web developers
can create well-structured and organized web pages that are easy to
navigate and interact with. Additionally, adhering to best practices for
HTML page structure can improve the page’s search engine optimization
(SEO) and overall user experience.</p>

<section id="how-css-works">
<h2>How CSS Works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-css-works" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets is a technology used to define the look and feel of
websites. CSS works by separating the presentation layer from the content
layer of a web page, allowing designers to control the visual aspects of a
site without affecting the underlying HTML code.</p>
<p>The basic principle of CSS is to apply styles to HTML elements. CSS
styles are defined in a separate file or in a style block within the HTML
file. Styles are written using a syntax that defines the type of element being
styled, followed by the properties and values that define the appearance of
the element.</p>
<p>For example, to define a style for a paragraph element, the following
syntax might be used:</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>p {
   font-family: Arial;
   font-size: 22px;
   color: #bb0d10;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>HTML Code:</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
   <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
         The properties font-family, font-size, and color
         are then defined, which set the font, font size,
         and color of the text within the paragraph element.
      <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">link</span> <span class="na">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;../../css/example.css&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
   <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Figure 1-6 shows what this code looks like in a browser.</p>
<p>Figure 1-6. CSS applied the font color for the &lt;p&gt; element</p>
<p>In this example, the p selector targets all &lt;p&gt; elements in the HTML
file. The properties font-family, font-size, and color are then defined, which
set the font, font size, and color of the text within the paragraph element.</p>
<p>CSS works by flowing styles down from the parent element to its
children. This means that if a style is defined for a parent element, it will be
inherited by its child elements unless a different style is explicitly defined.
For example, if a style is defined for the &lt;body&gt; element of a page, all
elements within the body will inherit that style unless a different style is
specified.</p>
<p>In addition to being cascading, CSS uses specificity to determine which
styles should be applied to an element. Specificity refers to the weight or
importance of a style rule. Styles with a higher specificity will override
styles with a lower specificity. Specificity is determined by a combination
of selectors, with more specific selectors taking precedence over less
specific ones.</p>
<p>For example, a style rule that targets a specific ID will have a higher
specificity than a rule that targets a class or element. The following
example demonstrates this:</p>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#header {
   background-color: blue;
}

.header {
   background-color: red;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here’s the HTML code:</p>

<p>CSS also provides a range of layout and positioning options that
allow designers to control the placement and arrangement of elements
on a page. These include the float property, which allows elements to be
positioned next to each other, and the position property, which allows
elements to be positioned absolutely or relatively within their parent
element.</p>
<p>In addition to these basic concepts, CSS provides a wide range of
advanced features and techniques, such as media queries, animation, and
responsive design. These features allow designers to create dynamic and
interactive websites that adapt to a variety of screen sizes and devices. We
are going to cover all these topics in later chapters.</p>
<p>CSS is a powerful technology that allows designers to control the
appearance of web pages in a flexible and modular way. By separating the
presentation layer from the content layer, CSS enables designers to create
sophisticated and engaging websites that are easy to maintain and update.
With its powerful layout and positioning options and advanced features,
CSS is a critical tool for modern web design.</p>

<h2>The Problem CSS Solves<a class="headerlink" href="#the-problem-css-solves" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>CSS is a critical technology for modern web design. By separating the
presentation layer from the content layer, CSS allows designers to create
consistent, flexible, and accessible websites that are easy to maintain and
update. With its wide range of styling options and advanced features, CSS
is an essential tool for creating engaging and effective websites.</p>
<p>Web development is a complex process that involves many different
technologies and tools. One of the most important technologies for web
development is CSS, which is a stylesheet language that is used to define
the visual appearance of web pages. CSS solves several common problems
that web developers face when creating websites.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Consistency across pages: One of the biggest challenges in web development is maintaining consistency across multiple pages. With CSS,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>developers can create a set of styles that can be applied to all pages on a website, ensuring a consistent look and feel. This makes it easier
for users to navigate the website and helps to establish a strong brand identity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Responsive design: Another common problem in web development is creating websites that are optimized for different screen sizes and devices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>CSS provides a range of tools and techniques for creating responsive designs, including media queries, flexible layouts, and viewport units. With
these tools, developers can create websites that look great on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, without having to create separate
designs for each device.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Browser compatibility: One of the most challenging aspects of web development is ensuring that websites look and function correctly across</p></li>
</ul>
<p>different web browsers. CSS provides a standardized way of defining styles, which helps to ensure that websites look consistent across different
browsers. Additionally, CSS provides fallback options for older browsers so that websites can still be viewed by users who may not have
the latest software.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Separation of content and presentation: One of the key principles of web development is the separation of content and presentation. CSS allows</p></li>
</ul>
<p>developers to create a clear separation between the content of a website and its visual appearance. This separation makes it easier to update the
design of a website without affecting the underlying content and makes it easier to maintain and update the website over time.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Accessibility: Accessibility is an important consideration in web development, as websites should be designed to be accessible to all users,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>including those with disabilities. CSS provides a range of tools and techniques for improving the accessibility of websites, such as using
high-contrast colors, providing text alternatives for images, and using semantic HTML markup.</p>
<p>CSS is an essential technology for web development, as it solves many
of the common problems that developers face when creating websites. CSS
provides tools and techniques for maintaining consistency across pages,
creating responsive designs, ensuring browser compatibility, separating
content and presentation, and improving accessibility. With CSS,
developers can create engaging and effective websites that are optimized
for a wide range of users and devices.</p>

<h2>CSS Selectors<a class="headerlink" href="#css-selectors" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>CSS selectors are a powerful feature of Cascading Style Sheets that allow
developers to target specific elements on a web page and apply styles to
them. CSS selectors make it possible to create unique and complex styles
for different elements and are an essential tool for creating effective and
engaging web designs. In this section, we will explore the basics of CSS
selectors and how they work.</p>
<p>CSS selectors are used to target specific elements on a web page, such
as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Selectors can be used to apply
styles to individual elements or to groups of elements. There are several
types of CSS selectors; each has its own syntax and functionality.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Type selectors: Type selectors target elements based on their HTML tag name. For example, the selector h1 would target all heading level 1</p></li>
</ul>
<p>elements on the page. Type selectors are the simplest type of selector and are often used to apply global styles to all elements of a particular
type.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Class selectors: Class selectors target elements based on their class attribute. The class attribute is used to assign a name to an element,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>which can then be targeted with a selector. For example, the selector .my-class would target all elements that have the class my-class assigned
to them. Class selectors are often used to apply styles to specific groups of elements, such as navigation menus or buttons.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ID selectors: ID selectors target elements based on their ID attribute. The ID attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an element,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>which can then be targeted with a selector. For example, the selector #my-id would target the element that has the ID my-id assigned to it. ID
selectors are often used to apply styles to specific elements, such as headers or footer sections.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Attribute selectors: Attribute selectors target elements based on their attributes, such as the src attribute for images or the href attribute</p></li>
</ul>
<p>for links. Attribute selectors can be used to target elements based on specific attribute values or to target elements that have a particular
attribute assigned to them.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements: Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are used to target elements based on their state or position within the</p></li>
</ul>
<p>document. Pseudo-classes are used to target elements based on user interactions, such as hovering over a link or clicking a button.
Pseudo-elements are used to target specific parts of an element, such as the first letter of a paragraph or the content of a link.</p>
<p>CSS selectors are an essential tool for web developers, as they allow
for precise targeting of specific elements on a web page. By using a
combination of type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute
selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements, developers can
create unique and complex styles for different elements on a web page.
Understanding CSS selectors is a fundamental aspect of web development
and is essential for creating effective and engaging web designs. All these
selectors will be covered as part of later chapters.</p>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter covered the technologies used in web development. It
also covered how HTML is rendered by a browser and its DOM tree, the
different HTML elements, and the way it is being displayed by the browser
using pseudo-code. It covered HTML page structure and how it can be
defined in multiple ways. We also looked at how CSS works along with
HTML and what kinds of problems can be solved using CSS and different
CSS selectors.</p>
