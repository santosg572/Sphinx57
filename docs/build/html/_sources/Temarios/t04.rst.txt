R is a free open-shareware software that can run on Unix, Windows, or Mac OS X
computer operating systems. The R software can be downloaded from the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) which is located at: http://cran.
r-project.org/. There are several sites or servers around the world where the soft-
ware can be downloaded, which is accessed at: http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.
