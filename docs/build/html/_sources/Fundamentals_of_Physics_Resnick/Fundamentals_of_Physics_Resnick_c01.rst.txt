Key Ideas

* The strength of a particle’s electrical interaction with objects around it depends on its electric charge (usually repre-
sented as q), which can be either positive or negative.
Particles with the same sign of charge repel each other, and
particles with opposite signs of charge attract each other.

* An object with equal amounts of the two kinds of charge is
electrically neutral, whereas one with an imbalance is electri-
cally charged and has an excess charge.

* Conductors are materials in which a significant number of
electrons are free to move. The charged particles in noncon-
ductors (insulators) are not free to move.

* Electric current i is the rate dq/dt at which charge passes a
point:

.. math::

   i = \frac{dq}{di}

* Coulomb’s law describes the electrostatic force (or electric force) between two charged particles. If the particles have
charges :math:`q_1` and :math:`q_2`, are separated by distance r, and are at rest
(or moving only slowly) relative to each other, then the magnitude of the force acting on each due to the other is given by

.. math::

   F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}

(Coulomb’s law),

where :math:`8.85 \times 10^{-12} c^2/N \cdot m^2` is the permittivity constant. The ratio 1/4p´0 is often replaced with the electrostatic
constant (or Coulomb constant) :math:`8.99 \times 10^{9} N \cdot m^2/C^2` .

* The electrostatic force vector acting on a charged particle
due to a second charged particle is either directly toward the
second particle (opposite signs of charge) or directly away
from it (same sign of charge).

* If multiple electrostatic forces act on a particle, the net force
is the vector sum (not scalar sum) of the individual forces.

* Shell theorem 1: A charged particle outside a shell with charge
uniformly distributed on its surface is attracted or repelled as if
the shell's charge were concentrated as a particle at its center.

* Shell theorem 2: A charged particle inside a shell with
charge uniformly distributed on its surface has no net force
acting on it due to the shell.

* Charge on a conducting spherical shell spreads uniformly
over the (external) surface.

What Is Physics?
----------------

You are surrounded by devices that depend on the physics of electromagnetism,
which is the combination of electric and magnetic phenomena. This physics is at
the root of computers, television, radio, telecommunications, household lighting,
and even the ability of food wrap to cling to a container. This physics is also the
basis of the natural world. Not only does it hold together all the atoms and
molecules in the world, it also produces lightning, auroras, and rainbows.

The physics of electromagnetism was first studied by the early Greek
philosophers, who discovered that if a piece of amber is rubbed and then brought
near bits of straw, the straw will jump to the amber. We now know that the attrac-
tion between amber and straw is due to an electric force. The Greek philosophers
also discovered that if a certain type of stone (a naturally occurring magnet) is
brought near bits of iron, the iron will jump to the stone. We now know that the
attraction between magnet and iron is due to a magnetic force.

From these modest origins with the Greek philosophers, the sciences of
electricity and magnetism developed separately for centuries—until 1820, in fact,
when Hans Christian Oersted found a connection between them: an electric cur-
rent in a wire can deflect a magnetic compass needle. Interestingly enough,
Oersted made this discovery, a big surprise, while preparing a lecture demonstra-
tion for his physics students.

The new science of electromagnetism was developed further by workers in
many countries. One of the best was Michael Faraday, a truly gifted experimenter
with a talent for physical intuition and visualization. That talent is attested to by
the fact that his collected laboratory notebooks do not contain a single equation.
In the mid-nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell put Faraday’s ideas into
mathematical form, introduced many new ideas of his own, and put electromag-
netism on a sound theoretical basis.

Our discussion of electromagnetism is spread through the next 16 chapters.
We begin with electrical phenomena, and our first step is to discuss the nature of
electric charge and electric force.

Electric Charge
---------------

Here are two demonstrations that seem to be magic, but our job here is to make
sense of them. After rubbing a glass rod with a silk cloth (on a day when the
humidity is low), we hang the rod by means of a thread tied around its center
(Fig. 21-la). Then we rub a second glass rod with the silk cloth and bring it near
the hanging rod. The hanging rod magically moves away. We can see that a force
repels it from the second rod, but how? There is no contact with that rod, no
breeze to push on it, and no sound wave to disturb it.

In the second demonstration we replace the second rod with a plastic rod
that has been rubbed with fur. This time, the hanging rod moves toward the
nearby rod (Fig. 21-1b). Like the repulsion, this attraction occurs without any
contact or obvious communication between the rods.

In the next chapter we shall discuss how the hanging rod knows of the pres-
ence of the other rods, but in this chapter let’s focus on just the forces that are in-
volved. In the first demonstration, the force on the hanging rod was repulsive, and
in the second, attractive. After a great many investigations, scientists figured out
that the forces in these types of demonstrations are due to the electric charge that
we set up on the rods when they are in contact with silk or fur. Electric charge is
an intrinsic property of the fundamental particles that make up objects such as
the rods, silk, and fur. That is, charge is a property that comes automatically with
those particles wherever they exist.

**Two Types**. There are two types of electric charge, named by the American
scientist and statesman Benjamin Franklin as positive charge and negative
charge. He could have called them anything (such as cherry and walnut), but us-
ing algebraic signs as names comes in handy when we add up charges to find the
net charge. In most everyday objects, such as a mug, there are about equal num-
bers of negatively charged particles and positively charged particles, and so the
net charge is zero, the charge is said to be balanced, and the object is said to be
electrically neutral (or just neutral for short).

**Excess Charge**. Normally you are approximately neutral. However, if you live in
regions where the humidity is low, you know that the charge on your body can be-
come slightly unbalanced when you walk across certain carpets. Either you gain neg-
ative charge from the carpet (at the points of contact between your shoes with the
carpet) and become negatively charged, or you lose negative charge and become pos-
itively charged. Either way, the extra charge is said to be an excess charge.You proba-
bly don’t notice it until you reach for a door handle or another person. Then, if your
excess charge is enough, a spark leaps between you and the other object, eliminating
your excess charge. Such sparking can be annoying and even somewhat painful. Such
charging and discharging does not happen in humid conditions because the water in
the air neutralizes your excess charge about as fast as you acquire it.

Two of the grand mysteries in physics are (1) why does the universe have par-
ticles with electric charge (what is it, really?) and (2) why does electric charge
come in two types (and not, say, one type or three types). We just do not know.
Nevertheless, with lots of experiments similar to our two demonstrations scien-
tists discovered that

Particles with the same sign of electrical charge repel each other, and particles
with opposite signs attract each other.

In a moment we shall put this rule into quantitative form as Coulomb’s law of
electrostatic force (or electric force) between charged particles. The term electro-
static is used to emphasize that, relative to each other, the charges are either sta-
tionary or moving only very slowly.

**Demos**. Now let’s get back to the demonstrations to understand the motions
of the rod as being something other than just magic. When we rub the glass rod
with a silk cloth, a small amount of negative charge moves from the rod to the silk
(a transfer like that between you and a carpet), leaving the rod with a small
amount of excess positive charge. (Which way the negative charge moves is not
obvious and requires a lot of experimentation.) We rub the silk over the rod to in-
crease the number of contact points and thus the amount, still tiny, of transferred
charge. We hang the rod from the thread so as to electrically isolate it from its sur-
roundings (so that the surroundings cannot neutralize the rod by giving it enough
negative charge to rebalance its charge). When we rub the second rod with the
silk cloth, it too becomes positively charged. So when we bring it near the first
rod, the two rods repel each other (Fig. 21-2a).

Next, when we rub the plastic rod with fur, it gains excess negative charge
from the fur. (Again, the transfer direction is learned through many experiments.)
When we bring the plastic rod (with negative charge) near the hanging glass rod
(with positive charge), the rods are attracted to each other (Fig. 21-2b). All this is
subtle.You cannot see the charge or its transfer, only the results.

Conductors and Insulators
-------------------------

We can classify materials generally according to the ability of charge to move
through them. Conductors are materials through which charge can move rather
freely; examples include metals (such as copper in common lamp wire), the human
body, and tap water. Nonconductors — also called insulators — are materials
through which charge cannot move freely; examples include rubber (such as the
insulation on common lamp wire), plastic, glass, and chemically pure water.
Semiconductors are materials that are intermediate between conductors and
insulators; examples include silicon and germanium in computer chips. Super-
conductors are materials that are perfect conductors, allowing charge to move with-
out any hindrance. In these chapters we discuss only conductors and insulators.

**Conducting Path**. Here is an example of how conduction can eliminate excess
charge on an object. If you rub a copper rod with wool, charge is transferred from the
wool to the rod. However, if you are holding the rod while also touching a faucet, you
cannot charge the rod in spite of the transfer. The reason is that you, the rod, and the
faucet are all conductors connected, via the plumbing, to Earth’s surface, which is a
huge conductor. Because the excess charges put on the rod by the wool repel one an-
other, they move away from one another by moving first through the rod, then
through you, and then through the faucet and plumbing to reach Earth’s surface,
where they can spread out.The process leaves the rod electrically neutral.

In thus setting up a pathway of conductors between an object and Earth’s
surface, we are said to ground the object, and in neutralizing the object (by elimi-
nating an unbalanced positive or negative charge), we are said to discharge the
object. If instead of holding the copper rod in your hand, you hold it by an
insulating handle, you eliminate the conducting path to Earth, and the rod can
then be charged by rubbing (the charge remains on the rod), as long as you do
not touch it directly with your hand.

**Charged Particles**. The properties of conductors and insulators are due to
the structure and electrical nature of atoms. Atoms consist of positively charged
protons, negatively charged electrons, and electrically neutral neutrons. The pro-
tons and neutrons are packed tightly together in a central nucleus.

The charge of a single electron and that of a single proton have the same
magnitude but are opposite in sign. Hence, an electrically neutral atom contains
equal numbers of electrons and protons. Electrons are held near the nucleus
because they have the electrical sign opposite that of the protons in the nucleus
and thus are attracted to the nucleus. Were this not true, there would be no
atoms and thus no you.

When atoms of a conductor like copper come together to form the solid,
some of their outermost (and so most loosely held) electrons become free to
wander about within the solid, leaving behind positively charged atoms ( positive
ions). We call the mobile electrons conduction electrons. There are few (if any)
free electrons in a nonconductor.

**Induced Charge**. The experiment of Fig. 21-3 demonstrates the mobility of
charge in a conductor. A negatively charged plastic rod will attract either end of
an isolated neutral copper rod. What happens is that many of the conduction
electrons in the closer end of the copper rod are repelled by the negative charge
on the plastic rod. Some of the conduction electrons move to the far end of the
copper rod, leaving the near end depleted in electrons and thus with an unbal-
anced positive charge. This positive charge is attracted to the negative charge in
the plastic rod. Although the copper rod is still neutral, it is said to have an
induced charge, which means that some of its positive and negative charges have
been separated due to the presence of a nearby charge.

Similarly, if a positively charged glass rod is brought near one end of a
neutral copper rod, induced charge is again set up in the neutral copper rod but
now the near end gains conduction electrons, becomes negatively charged, and is
attracted to the glass rod, while the far end is positively charged.

Note that only conduction electrons, with their negative charges, can move;
positive ions are fixed in place. Thus, an object becomes positively charged only
through the removal of negative charges.

**Blue Flashes from a Wintergreen LifeSaver**

Indirect evidence for the attraction of charges with opposite signs can be seen
with a wintergreen LifeSaver (the candy shaped in the form of a marine
lifesaver). If you adapt your eyes to darkness for about 15 minutes and then have
a friend chomp on a piece of the candy in the darkness, you will see a faint blue
flash from your friend’s mouth with each chomp. Whenever a chomp breaks a
sugar crystal into pieces, each piece will probably end up with a different number
of electrons. Suppose a crystal breaks into pieces A and B, with A ending up with
more electrons on its surface than B (Fig. 21-4). This means that B has positive
ions (atoms that lost electrons to A) on its surface. Because the electrons on A
are strongly attracted to the positive ions on B, some of those electrons jump
across the gap between the pieces.

As A and B move away from each other, air (primarily nitrogen, N 2 ) flows
into the gap, and many of the jumping electrons collide with nitrogen molecules
in the air, causing the molecules to emit ultraviolet light. You cannot see this type
of light. However, the wintergreen molecules on the surfaces of the candy pieces
absorb the ultraviolet light and then emit blue light, which you can see — it is the
blue light coming from your friend’s mouth.

**Checkpoint 1**

The figure shows five
pairs of plates: A, B, and
D are charged plastic
plates and C is an elec-
trically neutral copper
plate.The electrostatic
forces between the pairs
of plates are shown for
three of the pairs. For the remaining two pairs, do the plates repel or attract each other?

Coulomb’s Law
-------------

Now we come to the equation for Coulomb’s law, but first a caution. This equa-
tion works for only charged particles (and a few other things that can be treated
as particles). For extended objects, with charge located in many different places,
we need more powerful techniques. So, here we consider just charged particles
and not, say, two charged cats.

If two charged particles are brought near each other, they each exert an elec-
trostatic force on the other. The direction of the force vectors depends on the
signs of the charges. If the particles have the same sign of charge, they repel each
other. That means that the force vector on each is directly away from the other
particle (Figs. 21-5a and b). If we release the particles, they accelerate away from
each other. If, instead, the particles have opposite signs of charge, they attract
each other. That means that the force vector on each is directly toward the other
particle (Fig. 21-5c). If we release the particles, they accelerate toward each other.

The equation for the electrostatic forces acting on the particles is called
Coulomb’s law after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, whose experiments in 1785 led
him to it. Let’s write the equation in vector form and in terms of the particles shown
in Fig. 21-6, where particle 1 has charge q1 and particle 2 has charge q2. (These sym-
bols can represent either positive or negative charge.) Let’s also focus on particle 1
and write the force acting on it in terms of a unit vector that points along a radial
axis extending through the two particles, radially away from particle 2. (As with
other unit vectors, has a magnitude of exactly 1 and no unit; its purpose is to
point, like a direction arrow on a street sign.) With these decisions, we write the
electrostatic force as

.. math::

  \overrightarrow{F} = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} \hat{r}

(Coulomb’s law), (21-1)

where r is the separation between the particles and k is a positive constant called
the electrostatic constant or the Coulomb constant. (We’ll discuss k below.)

Let’s first check the direction of the force on particle 1 as given by Eq. 21-1. If
q1 and q2 have the same sign, then the product q1q2 gives us a positive result. So,
Eq. 21-1 tells us that the force on particle 1 is in the direction of . That checks, be-
cause particle 1 is being repelled from particle 2. Next, if q1 and q2 have opposite
signs, the product q1q2 gives us a negative result. So, now Eq. 21-1 tells us that the
force on particle 1 is in the direction opposite . That checks because particle 1 is
being attracted toward particle 2.

**An Aside**. Here is something that is very curious. The form of Eq. 21-1 is the
same as that of Newton’s equation (Eq. 13-3) for the gravitational force between
two particles with masses m1 and m2 and separation r:

.. math::

   \overrightarrow{F} = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2} \hat{r}

(Newton’s law), (21-2)

where G is the gravitational constant. Although the two types of forces are wildly
different, both equations describe inverse square laws (the :math:`1/r^2` dependences)
that involve a product of a property of the interacting particles—the charge in
one case and the mass in the other. However, the laws differ in that gravitational
forces are always attractive but electrostatic forces may be either attractive or re-
pulsive, depending on the signs of the charges. This difference arises from the fact
that there is only one type of mass but two types of charge.

**Unit**. The SI unit of charge is the coulomb. For practical reasons having to do
with the accuracy of measurements, the coulomb unit is derived from the SI unit am-
pere for electric current i. We shall discuss current in detail in Chapter 26, but here
let’s just note that current i is the rate dq/dt at which charge moves past a point or
through a region:

.. math::

   i = \frac{dq}{dt}

(electric current). (21-3)

Rearranging Eq. 21-3 and replacing the symbols with their units (coulombs C,
amperes A, and seconds s) we see that

1 C = (1 A)(1 s).

**Force Magnitude**. For historical reasons (and because doing so simplifies
many other formulas), the electrostatic constant k in Eq. 21-1 is often written as
1/4p´0. Then the magnitude of the electrostatic force in Coulomb’s law becomes

.. math::

   F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}

(Coulomb’s law). (21-4)

The constants in Eqs. 21-1 and 21-4 have the value

.. math::

   k = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} = 8.99 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2

(21-5)

The quantity :math:`\varepsilon_0`, called the permittivity constant, sometimes appears separately in
equations and is

.. math::

   \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} C^2/N \cdot m^2

. (21-6)

**Working a Problem**. Note that the charge magnitudes appear in Eq. 21-4,
which gives us the force magnitude. So, in working problems in this chapter, we
use Eq. 21-4 to find the magnitude of a force on a chosen particle due to a second
particle and we separately determine the direction of the force by considering the
charge signs of the two particles.

**Multiple Forces**. As with all forces in this book, the electrostatic force obeys
the principle of superposition. Suppose we have n charged particles near a chosen
particle called particle 1; then the net force on particle 1 is given by the vector sum

.. math::

   \overrightarrow{F}_{1,net} = \overrightarrow{F}_{12} + \overrightarrow{F}_{13} +\overrightarrow{F}_{14} + ... \overrightarrow{F}_{1n}  

(21-7)

in which, for example, :math:`\overrightarrow{F}_{14}` is the force on particle 1 due to the presence of particle 4.

This equation is the key to many of the homework problems, so let’s state it
in words. If you want to know the net force acting on a chosen charged particle
that is surrounded by other charged particles, first clearly identify that chosen
particle and then find the force on it due to each of the other particles. Draw
those force vectors in a free-body diagram of the chosen particle, with the tails
anchored on the particle. (That may sound trivial, but failing to do so easily leads
to errors.) Then add all those forces as vectors according to the rules of Chapter 3,
not as scalars. (You cannot just willy-nilly add up their magnitudes.) The result is
the net force (or resultant force) acting on the particle.

Although the vector nature of the forces makes the homework problems
harder than if we simply had scalars, be thankful that Eq. 21-7 works. If two force
vectors did not simply add but for some reason amplified each other, the world
would be very difficult to understand and manage.

Shell Theories. Analogous to the shell theories for the gravitational force
(Module 13-1), we have two shell theories for the electrostatic force:

Shell theory 1. A charged particle outside a shell with charge uniformly distrib-
uted on its surface is attracted or repelled as if the shell’s charge were concentrated
as a particle at its center.

Shell theory 2. A charged particle inside a shell with charge uniformly distributed
on its surface has no net force acting on it due to the shell.

(In the first theory, we assume that the charge on the shell is much greater than
the particle’s charge. Thus the presence of the particle has negligible effect on the
distribution of charge on the shell.)

**Spherical Conductors**

If excess charge is placed on a spherical shell that is made of conducting material, the
excess charge spreads uniformly over the (external) surface. For example, if we place
excess electrons on a spherical metal shell, those electrons repel one another and
tend to move apart, spreading over the available surface until they are uniformly dis-
tributed. That arrangement maximizes the distances between all pairs of the excess
electrons. According to the first shell theorem, the shell then will attract or repel an
external charge as if all the excess charge on the shell were concentrated at its center.

If we remove negative charge from a spherical metal shell, the resulting pos-
itive charge of the shell is also spread uniformly over the surface of the shell. For
example, if we remove n electrons, there are then n sites of positive charge (sites
missing an electron) that are spread uniformly over the shell. According to the
first shell theorem, the shell will again attract or repel an external charge as if all
the shell’s excess charge were concentrated at its center.

**Checkpoint 2**

The figure shows two protons
(symbol p) and one electron
(symbol e) on an axis. On the central proton, what is the direction of (a) the force due to the
electron, (b) the force due to the other proton, and (c) the net force?

**Sample Problem 21.01 Finding the net force due to two other particles**

This sample problem actually contains three examples, to
build from basic stuff to harder stuff. In each we have the
same charged particle 1. First there is a single force acting
on it (easy stuff). Then there are two forces, but they are just
in opposite directions (not too bad). Then there are again
two forces but they are in very different directions (ah, now
we have to get serious about the fact that they are vectors).
The key to all three examples is to draw the forces correctly
before you reach for a calculator, otherwise you may be cal-
culating nonsense on the calculator. (Figure 21-7 is available
in WileyPLUS as an animation with voiceover.)

(a) Figure 21-7a shows two positively charged particles fixed in
place on an x axis. The charges are :math:`q_1 =1.60 \times 10^{-19} C` and
:math:`q_2 = 3.20 \times 10^{-19} C`, and the particle separation is R= 0.0200 m.
What are the magnitude and direction of the electrostatic force \overrightarrow{F}_{12}`
on particle 1 from particle 2?

KEY IDEAS

Because both particles are positively charged, particle 1 is repelled by particle 2, with a force magnitude given by Eq. 21-4.
Thus, the direction of force :math:`\overrightarrow{F}_{12}` on particle 1 is away from parti-
cle 2, in the negative direction of the x axis, as indicated in the
free-body diagram of Fig. 21-7b.

Two particles: Using Eq. 21-4 with separation R substituted
for r, we can write the magnitude :math:`F_{12}` of this force as

.. math::

   \begin{array}{rcl}
   F_{12} & = & \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{R^2} \\
   & = & (8.99 \times 10 ^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2) \\
   & \times & \frac{(1.60 \times 10 ^{-19}C)(3.20 \times 10 ^{-19}C)}{(0.0200 m)^2} \\
   & = & 1.15 \times 10^{-24}N
   \end{array}

Thus, force :math:`\overrightarrow{F}_{12}`  has the following magnitude and direction
(relative to the positive direction of the x axis):

.. math::

   \overrightarrow{F}_{12} = -(1.15 \times 10^{-24} N` and 180^o

 (Answer)

We can also write :math:`\overrightarrow{F}_{12}` in unit-vector notation as

.. math::

   \overrightarrow{F}_{12} = -(1.15 \times 10^{-24} N) \hat{i}

. (Answer)

(b) Figure 21-7c is identical to Fig. 21-7a except that particle 3
now lies on the x axis between particles 1 and 2. Particle 3
has charge :math:`q_3 = -3.20 \times 10^{-19} C` and is at a distance from :math:`\frac{3}{4}R`
from article 1.What is the net electrostatic force :math:`\overrightarrow{F}_{1,net}`  on particle 1
due to particles 2 and 3?

KEY IDEA

The presence of particle 3 does not alter the electrostatic force
on particle 1 from particle 2.Thus, force still acts on particle
1. Similarly, the force that acts on particle 1 due to particle 3
is not affected by the presence of particle 2. Because particles 1

and 3 have charge of opposite signs, particle 1 is attracted
to particle 3.Thus, force is directed toward particle 3, as indicated in the free-body diagram of Fig. 21-7d.

Sample Problem 21.02 Equilibrium of two forces on a particle

Figure 21-8a shows two particles fixed in place: a particle of
charge q1 ␄ ␃8q at the origin and a particle of charge q2 ␄ ␅2q
at x ␄ L. At what point (other than infinitely far away) can a
proton be placed so that it is in equilibrium (the net force on it is
zero)? Is that equilibrium stable or unstable? (That is, if the pro-
ton is displaced, do the forces drive it back to the point of equi-
librium or drive it farther away?)
KEY IDEA
If is the force on the proton due to charge q1 and is the
force on the proton due to charge q2, then the point we seek is
where Thus,
(21-8)
This tells us that at the point we seek, the forces acting on
the proton due to the other two particles must be of equal
magnitudes,
F1 ␄ F2, (21-9)
and that the forces must have opposite directions.
Reasoning: Because a proton has a positive charge, the pro-
ton and the particle of charge q1 are of the same sign, and
force on the proton must point away from q1. Also, the
proton and the particle of charge q2 are of opposite signs, so
force on the proton must point toward q2. “Away from q1”
and “toward q2” can be in opposite directions only if the pro-
ton is located on the x axis.
If the proton is on the x axis at any point between q1 and
q2, such as point P in Fig. 21-8b, then and are in the
same direction and not in opposite directions as required.
If the proton is at any point on the x axis to the left of q1,
such as point S in Fig. 21-8c, then and are in opposite
directions. However, Eq. 21-4 tells us that and can-
not have equal magnitudes there: F1 must be greater than F2,
because F1 is produced by a closer charge (with lesser r) of
greater magnitude (8q versus 2q).
Finally, if the proton is at any point on the x axis to the
right of q2, such as point R in Fig. 21-8d, then and are
again in opposite directions. However, because now the
charge of greater magnitude (q1) is farther away from the pro-
ton than the charge of lesser magnitude, there is a point at
which F1 is equal to F2. Let x be the coordinate of this point,
and let qp be the charge of the proton

igure 21-8 (a) Two particles of charges q1 and q2 are fixed in place on
an x axis, with separation L. (b) – (d) Three possible locations P, S,
and R for a proton. At each location, is the force on the protonF

from particle 1 and is the force on the proton from particle 2

Calculations: With Eq.21-4,we can now rewrite Eq.21-9:
(21-10)
(Note that only the charge magnitudes appear in Eq.
21-10. We already decided about the directions of the forces
in drawing Fig. 21-8d and do not want to include any posi-
tive or negative signs here.) Rearranging Eq. 21-10 gives us
After taking the square roots of both sides, we find
x ␄ 2L. (Answer)
The equilibrium at x ␄ 2L is unstable; that is, if the proton is
displaced leftward from point R, then F1 and F2 both increase
but F2 increases more (because q2 is closer than q1), and a net
force will drive the proton farther leftward. If the proton is dis-
placed rightward, both F1 and F2 decrease but F2 decreases
more, and a net force will then drive the proton farther right-
ward. In a stable equilibrium, if the proton is displaced slightly, it
returns to the equilibrium position

Sample Problem 21.03 Charge sharing by two identical conducting sphere

In Fig. 21-9a, two identical, electrically isolated conducting
spheres A and B are separated by a (center-to-center) dis-
tance a that is large compared to the spheres. Sphere A has
a positive charge of ␃Q, and sphere B is electrically neutral.
Initially, there is no electrostatic force between the spheres.
(The large separation means there is no induced charge.)
(a) Suppose the spheres are connected for a moment by a
conducting wire. The wire is thin enough so that any net
charge on it is negligible. What is the electrostatic force
between the spheres after the wire is removed?
KEY IDEAS
(1) Because the spheres are identical, connecting them means
that they end up with identical charges (same sign and same
amount). (2) The initial sum of the charges (including the
signs of the charges) must equal the final sum of the charges.
Reasoning: When the spheres are wired together, the (nega-
tive) conduction electrons on B, which repel one another,
have a way to move away from one another (along the wire
to positively charged A, which attracts them—Fig. 21-9b). As
B loses negative charge, it becomes positively charged, and as
A gains negative charge, it becomes less positively charged.
The transfer of charge stops when the charge on B has in-
creased to ␃Q/2 and the charge on A has decreased to ␃Q/2,
which occurs when ␅Q/2 has shifted from B to A.
After the wire has been removed (Fig. 21-9c), we can
assume that the charge on either sphere does not disturb the
uniformity of the charge distribution on the other sphere,
because the spheres are small relative to their separation.Thus,
we can apply the first shell theorem to each sphere. By Eq. 21-4
with q1 ␄ q2 ␄ Q/2 and r ␄ a

Figure 21-9 Two small conducting spheres A and B. (a) To start, sphere A
is charged positively. (b) Negative charge is transferred from B to A
through a connecting wire. (c) Both spheres are then charged posi-
tively. (d) Negative charge is transferred through a grounding wire to
sphere A. (e) Sphere A is then neutral

The spheres, now positively charged, repel each other.
(b) Next, suppose sphere A is grounded momentarily, and
then the ground connection is removed. What now is the
electrostatic force between the spheres?
Reasoning: When we provide a conducting path between a
charged object and the ground (which is a huge conductor),
we neutralize the object. Were sphere A negatively charged,
the mutual repulsion between the excess electrons would
cause them to move from the sphere to the ground.
However, because sphere A is positively charged, electrons
with a total charge of ␅Q/2 move from the ground up onto
the sphere (Fig. 21-9d), leaving the sphere with a charge of 0
(Fig. 21-9e). Thus, the electrostatic force is again zero.


21-2 CHARGE IS QUANTIZED
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
21.19 Identify the elementary charge.
21.20 Identify that the charge of a particle or object must be a
positive or negative integer times the elementary charge.

● Electric charge is quantized (restricted to certain values).
● The charge of a particle can be written as ne, where n is a
positive or negative integer and e is the elementary charge,
which is the magnitude of the charge of the electron and
proton (␆ 1.602 ␈ 10␅19 C).
Learning Objectives


harge Is Quantized
In Benjamin Franklin’s day, electric charge was thought to be a continuous
fluid — an idea that was useful for many purposes. However, we now know tha

luids themselves, such as air and water, are not continuous but are made up of
atoms and molecules; matter is discrete. Experiment shows that “electrical fluid”
is also not continuous but is made up of multiples of a certain elementary charge.
Any positive or negative charge q that can be detected can be written as
q ␄ ne, n ␄ ␂1, ␂2, ␂3, . . . , (21-11)
in which e, the elementary charge, has the approximate value
e ␄ 1.602 ␈ 10␅19 C. (21-12)
The elementary charge e is one of the important constants of nature. The electron
and proton both have a charge of magnitude e (Table 21-1). (Quarks, the con-
stituent particles of protons and neutrons, have charges of ␂e/3 or ␂2e/3, but they
apparently cannot be detected individually. For this and for historical reasons, we
do not take their charges to be the elementary charge.)
You often see phrases — such as “the charge on a sphere,” “the amount of
charge transferred,” and “the charge carried by the electron” — that suggest that
charge is a substance. (Indeed, such statements have already appeared in this
chapter.) You should, however, keep in mind what is intended: Particles are the
substance and charge happens to be one of their properties, just as mass is.
When a physical quantity such as charge can have only discrete values rather
than any value, we say that the quantity is quantized. It is possible, for example, to
find a particle that has no charge at all or a charge of ␃10e or ␅6e, but not a parti-
cle with a charge of, say, 3.57e.
The quantum of charge is small. In an ordinary 100 W lightbulb, for example,
about 10 19 elementary charges enter the bulb every second and just as many
leave. However, the graininess of electricity does not show up in such large-scale
phenomena (the bulb does not flicker with each electron).

Checkpoint 4
Initially, sphere A has a charge of ␅50e and sphere B has a charge of ␃20e. The
spheres are made of conducting material and are identical in size. If the spheres then
touch, what is the resulting charge on sphere A?

Sample Problem 21.04 Mutual electric repulsion in a nucleus

he nucleus in an iron atom has a radius of about 4.0 ␈
10␅15 m and contains 26 protons.
(a) What is the magnitude of the repulsive electrostatic force be-
tween two of the protons that are separated by 4.0 ␈ 10␅15 m?
KEY IDEA
The protons can be treated as charged particles, so the mag-
nitude of the electrostatic force on one from the other is
given by Coulomb’s law.
Calculation: Table 21-1 tells us that the charge of a proton is
␃e. Thus, Eq. 21-4 gives us
. (Answer)␄ 14 N

No explosion: This is a small force to be acting on a macro-
scopic object like a cantaloupe, but an enormous force to be
acting on a proton. Such forces should explode the nucleus
of any element but hydrogen (which has only one proton in
its nucleus). However, they don’t, not even in nuclei with a
great many protons. Therefore, there must be some enor-
mous attractive force to counter this enormous repulsive
electrostatic force.
(b) What is the magnitude of the gravitational force
between those same two protons?
KEY IDEA
Because the protons are particles, the magnitude of the
gravitational force on one from the other is given by
Newton’s equation for the gravitational force (Eq. 21-2).
Calculation: With mp (␄ 1.67 ␈ 10␅27 kg) representing the

mass of a proton, Eq. 21-2 gives us
. (Answer)
Weak versus strong: This result tells us that the (attractive)
gravitational force is far too weak to counter the repulsive
electrostatic forces between protons in a nucleus. Instead,
the protons are bound together by an enormous force called

aptly) the strong nuclear force — a force that acts between
protons (and neutrons) when they are close together, as in a
nucleus.
Although the gravitational force is many times weaker
than the electrostatic force, it is more important in large-
scale situations because it is always attractive.This means that
it can collect many small bodies into huge bodies with huge
masses, such as planets and stars, that then exert large gravita-
tional forces. The electrostatic force, on the other hand, is re-
pulsive for charges of the same sign, so it is unable to collect
either positive charge or negative charge into large concen-
trations that would then exert large electrostatic forces.

21-3 CHARGE IS CONSERVED
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
21.21 Identify that in any isolated physical process, the net
charge cannot change (the net charge is always conserved).
21.22 Identify an annihilation process of particles and a pair
production of particles.
21.23 Identify mass number and atomic number in terms of
the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

 The net electric charge of any isolated system is always
conserved.
● If two charged particles undergo an annihilation process,
they have opposite signs of charge.
● If two charged particles appear as a result of a pair produc-
tion process, they have opposite signs of charge.

Charge Is Conserved
If you rub a glass rod with silk, a positive charge appears on the rod. Measure-
ment shows that a negative charge of equal magnitude appears on the silk. This
suggests that rubbing does not create charge but only transfers it from one body
to another, upsetting the electrical neutrality of each body during the process.
This hypothesis of conservation of charge, first put forward by Benjamin
Franklin, has stood up under close examination, both for large-scale charged
bodies and for atoms, nuclei, and elementary particles. No exceptions have ever
been found. Thus, we add electric charge to our list of quantities — including
energy and both linear momentum and angular momentum — that obey a con-
servation law.
Important examples of the conservation of charge occur in the radioactive
decay of nuclei, in which a nucleus transforms into (becomes) a different type of
nucleus. For example, a uranium-238 nucleus ( 238
U) transforms into a thorium-
234 nucleus ( 234 Th) by emitting an alpha particle. Because that particle has the
same makeup as a helium-4 nucleus, it has the symbol 4He. The number used in
the name of a nucleus and as a superscript in the symbol for the nucleus is called
the mass number and is the total number of the protons and neutrons in the
nucleus. For example, the total number in 238 U is 238. The number of protons in
a nucleus is the atomic number Z, which is listed for all the elements in Appendix F.
From that list we find that in the decay
238 U : 234 Th ␃ 4
He, (21-13)

622 CHAPTE R 21 COU LOM B’S L AW
the parent nucleus 238 U contains 92 protons (a charge of ␃92e), the daughter
nucleus 234 Th contains 90 protons (a charge of ␃90e), and the emitted alpha parti-
cle 4He contains 2 protons (a charge of ␃2e). We see that the total charge is ␃92e
before and after the decay; thus, charge is conserved. (The total number of pro-
tons and neutrons is also conserved: 238 before the decay and 234 ␃ 4 ␄ 238
after the decay.)
Another example of charge conservation occurs when an electron e␅ (charge
␅e) and its antiparticle, the positron e␃ (charge ␃e), undergo an annihilation
process, transforming into two gamma rays (high-energy light):
e␅ ␃ e␃ : g ␃ g (annihilation). (21-14)
In applying the conservation-of-charge principle, we must add the charges alge-
braically, with due regard for their signs. In the annihilation process of Eq. 21-14
then, the net charge of the system is zero both before and after the event. Charge
is conserved.
In pair production, the converse of annihilation, charge is also conserved. In
this process a gamma ray transforms into an electron and a positron:
g : e␅ ␃ e␃ (pair production) . (21-15)
Figure 21-10 shows such a pair-production event that occurred in a bubble cham-
ber. (This is a device in which a liquid is suddenly made hotter than its boiling
point. If a charged particle passes through it, tiny vapor bubbles form along the
particle’s trail.) A gamma ray entered the chamber from the bottom and at one
point transformed into an electron and a positron. Because those new particles
were charged and moving, each left a trail of bubbles. (The trails were curved
because a magnetic field had been set up in the chamber.) The gamma ray, being
electrically neutral, left no trail. Still, you can tell exactly where it underwent pair
production — at the tip of the curved V, which is where the trails of the electron
and positron begin

Electric Charge The strength of a particle’s electrical interaction
with objects around it depends on its electric charge (usually repre-
sented as q), which can be either positive or negative. Particles with
the same sign of charge repel each other, and particles with opposite
signs of charge attract each other. An object with equal amounts of
the two kinds of charge is electrically neutral, whereas one with an
imbalance is electrically charged and has an excess charge.
Conductors are materials in which a significant number of
electrons are free to move. The charged particles in nonconductors
(insulators) are not free to move.
Electric current i is the rate dq/dt at which charge passes a point:
(electric current). (21-3)
Coulomb’s Law Coulomb’s law describes the electrostatic
force (or electric force) between two charged particles. If the parti-
cles have charges q1 and q2 , are separated by distance r, and are at
rest (or moving only slowly) relative to each other, then the magni-
tude of the force acting on each due to the other is given by
(Coulomb’s law), (21-4)

The electrostatic force vector acting on a charged particle due
to a second charged particle is either directly toward the second
particle (opposite signs of charge) or directly away from it (same
sign of charge).As with other types of forces, if multiple electrostatic
forces act on a particle, the net force is the vector sum (not scalar
sum) of the individual forces.
The two shell theories for electrostatics are
Shell theorem 1: A charged particle outside a shell with charge
uniformly distributed on its surface is attracted or repelled as if
the shell’s charge were concentrated as a particle at its center.
Shell theorem 2: A charged particle inside a shell with charge
uniformly distributed on its surface has no net force acting on it
due to the shell.
Charge on a conducting spherical shell spreads uniformly over the
(external) surface.
The Elementary Charge Electric charge is quantized (re-
stricted to certain values). The charge of a particle can be written
as ne, where n is a positive or negative integer and e is the elemen-
tary charge, which is the magnitude of the charge of the electron
and proton (␆ 1.602 ␈ 10␅19 C).
Conservation of Charge The net electric charge of any iso-
lated system is always conserved.

 Figure 21-18 shows four situations in which particles of
charge ␃q or ␅q are fixed in place. In each situation, the parti

les on the x axis are equidistant from the y axis. First, consider
the middle particle in situation 1; the middle particle experiences
an electrostatic force from each of the other two particles.
(a) Are the magnitudes F of those forces the same or different?
(b) Is the magnitude of the net force on the middle particle
equal to, greater than, or less than 2F ? (c) Do the x components
of the two forces add or cancel? (d) Do their y components add
or cancel? (e) Is the direction of the net force on the middle particle
that of the canceling components or the adding components? (f)
What is the direction of that net force? Now consider the remaining
situations: What is the direction of the net force on the middle parti-
cle in (g) situation 2, (h) situation 3, and (i) situation 4? (In each
situation, consider the symmetry of the charge distribution and
determine the canceling components and the adding components.)

into bubble C, which then drifts to the container’s floor. When
bubble C reaches the floor, a charge of ␅3e is transferred up-
ward through the wire, from the ground to the container, as in-
dicated. (a) What was the initial charge of each bubble? When
