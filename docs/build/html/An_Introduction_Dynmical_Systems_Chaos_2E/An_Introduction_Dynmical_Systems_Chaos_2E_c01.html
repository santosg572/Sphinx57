<p>Dynamics is a time-evolutionary process. It may be deterministic or stochastic. Longterm predictions of some systems often become impossible. Even their trajectories
cannot be represented by usual geometry. In many natural and social phenomena
there is unpredictability. Unpredictability is an intrinsic property which is present
in the phenomenon itself. It has a great impact on human civilization as well as
scientific thoughts. There are numerous questions in human mind; e.g., how can a
deterministic trajectory be unpredictable? What are the causes in the formation of
symmetric crystals and snowflakes in nature? How can one find chaotic trajectories?
Can a deterministic trajectory be random? How can one define and explain turbulence
in fluid motion? Is there any local symmetry in chaos? How can one relate chaotic
dynamics with fractal object? For answering these questions, we have no way but to
study nonlinear dynamics.</p>
<p>La dinámica es un proceso evolutivo en el tiempo. Puede ser determinista o estocástica. Las predicciones a largo plazo de algunos sistemas a menudo se vuelven
imposibles. Incluso sus trayectorias no pueden representarse mediante la geometría habitual. En muchos fenómenos naturales y sociales existe imprevisibilidad. La
imprevisibilidad es una propiedad intrínseca presente en el fenómeno mismo. Tiene un gran impacto en la civilización humana, así como en el pensamiento científico.
Existen numerosas preguntas en la mente humana; por ejemplo, ¿cómo puede una trayectoria determinista ser impredecible? ¿Cuáles son las causas de la formación de
cristales simétricos y copos de nieve en la naturaleza? ¿Cómo se pueden encontrar trayectorias caóticas? ¿Puede una trayectoria determinista ser aleatoria? ¿Cómo se
puede definir y explicar la turbulencia en el movimiento de un fluido? ¿Existe alguna simetría local en el caos? ¿Cómo se puede relacionar la dinámica caótica con
un objeto fractal? Para responder a estas preguntas, no tenemos más remedio que estudiar la dinámica no lineal.</p>
<p>Dynamical systems are generally described by differential or difference equations.
Studies of differential equations in mathematics were devoted mainly of finding
analytical solutions of equations for more than two centuries. But the dynamical
behaviors of a system may not always be determined by analytical or closed-form
solutions. Moreover, analytical solutions of nonlinear equations are difficult to obtain
except in a few special cases. The subject dynamical systems had evolved at the
end of nineteenth century and made significant contributions to understanding some
nonlinear phenomena. The dynamics of a system may be expressed either as a
continuous-time or as a discrete-time-evolutionary process. The simplest mathematical models of continuous systems are those consisting of first-order differential
equations. In first-order autonomous system (explicit in time), the dynamics is a very
restrictive class of system since its motion is in the real line. In simple nonautonomous
cases, on the other hand, the dynamics is very rich.</p>
<p>Los sistemas dinámicos se describen generalmente mediante ecuaciones diferenciales o de diferencias. Los estudios de ecuaciones diferenciales en matemáticas se
dedicaron principalmente a encontrar soluciones analíticas de ecuaciones durante más de dos siglos. Pero los comportamientos dinámicos de un sistema no siempre
pueden determinarse mediante soluciones analíticas o de forma cerrada. Además, las soluciones analíticas de ecuaciones no lineales son difíciles de obtener, excepto
en unos pocos casos especiales. Los sistemas dinámicos en cuestión habían evolucionado a finales del siglo XIX y habían hecho contribuciones significativas a la
comprensión de algunos fenómenos no lineales. La dinámica de un sistema puede expresarse como un proceso evolutivo en tiempo continuo o en tiempo discreto. Los
modelos matemáticos más simples de sistemas continuos son aquellos que consisten en ecuaciones diferenciales de primer orden. En un sistema autónomo de primer orden
(explícito en el tiempo), la dinámica es una clase de sistema muy restrictiva, ya que su movimiento es en la línea real. En casos simples no autónomos, por otro
lado, la dinámica es muy rica.</p>

<p>of natural and social sciences. Examples include physical science (e.g., earth’s atmosphere, laser, electronic circuit, superconductivity, fluid turbulence, etc.),
chemistry (Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, Brusselator model, etc.), biology (neural
and cardiac systems, biochemical processes), ecology and social sciences (spreading
of fading, spreading diseases, price fluctuations of markets and stock markets, etc.),
to mention a few. Nonlinear systems are harder (if not sometimes impossible) to
solve than linear systems, because the latter follow the superposition principle and
can be divided into parts. Each part can be solved individually and adding them all
provides the final result. However, solutions of linear systems are helpful for the
analysis of nonlinear systems.</p>

modelo de Brusselator, etc.), la biología (sistemas neuronales y cardíacos, procesos bioquímicos), la ecología y las ciencias sociales (propagación del
desvanecimiento, propagación de enfermedades, fluctuaciones de precios en los mercados bursátiles, etc.), por mencionar solo algunos. Los sistemas no lineales son
más difíciles (si no a veces imposibles) de resolver que los sistemas lineales, ya que estos últimos siguen el principio de superposición y pueden dividirse en
partes. Cada parte puede resolverse individualmente y la suma de todas proporciona el resultado final. Sin embargo, las soluciones de sistemas lineales son útiles
para el análisis de sistemas no lineales.</p>

<h2>1.1 Dynamics: A Brief History<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamics-a-brief-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The explicit time behaviors of a system and its dependency on initial conditions of
solutions began after the 1880s. It is well known that analytical or closed-form solutions of nonlinear equations cannot be obtained except for very few special forms.
Moreover, the solutions behaviors at different initial conditions or their asymptotic
characters are sometimes cumbersome to determine from closed-form solutions. In
this situation scientists felt the necessity for developing a method that determines
the qualitative features of a system rather than the quantitative analysis. The French
mathematician Henri Poincaré (1854–1912) pioneered the qualitative approach, a
combination of analysis and geometry which was proved to be a powerful approach
for analyzing behaviors of a system and brought Poincaré recognition as the ‘father
of nonlinear dynamics’.</p>
<p>El comportamiento temporal explícito de un sistema y su dependencia de las condiciones iniciales de las soluciones comenzaron después de la década de 1880. Es bien
sabido que las soluciones analíticas o de forma cerrada de ecuaciones no lineales no pueden obtenerse excepto para muy pocas formas especiales. Además, el
comportamiento de las soluciones en diferentes condiciones iniciales o sus caracteres asintóticos son a veces engorrosos de determinar a partir de soluciones de
forma cerrada. En esta situación, los científicos sintieron la necesidad de desarrollar un método que determinara las características cualitativas de un sistema en
lugar del análisis cuantitativo. El matemático francés Henri Poincaré (1854-1912) fue pionero del enfoque cualitativo, una combinación de análisis y geometría que
demostró ser un método poderoso para analizar el comportamiento de un sistema y le otorgó el reconocimiento como el “padre de la dinámica no lineal”.</p>
<p>The time-evolutionary process governed either by linear
or nonlinear equations gives the dynamical system. Dynamics and its representations are inextricably tied with mathematics. The subject was initiated informally
from the different views of mathematicians and physicists. Studies began in the mid1600s when Newton (1643–1727) invented calculus, differential equations, the laws
of motion, and universal gravitation. With the help of Newton’s discoveries, the laws
of planetary motions, already postulated by Jonaesh Kepler, a German astrologist
(1609, 1619) were established mathematically and the study of dynamical systems
commenced. In the qualitative approach, the local, long-term, and asymptotic behaviors of an equation could be explained. Unfortunately, the qualitative study was
restricted to mathematicians only. However, the power and necessity of the qualitative approach for analyzing the dynamical evolution of a system were subsequently
enriched by A. M. Lyapunov (1857–1918), G. D. Birkhoff (1908–1944) and a group
of mathematicians from the Russian schools, viz. A. A. Andronov, V. I. Arnold, and
coworkers (1937, 1966, 1971, 1973).</p>
<p>El proceso evolutivo temporal, gobernado por ecuaciones lineales o no lineales, da lugar al sistema dinámico. La dinámica y sus representaciones están
inextricablemente ligadas a las matemáticas. El tema se inició informalmente a partir de las diferentes perspectivas de matemáticos y físicos. Los estudios
comenzaron a mediados del siglo XVII, cuando Newton (1643-1727) inventó el cálculo, las ecuaciones diferenciales, las leyes del movimiento y la gravitación
universal. Con la ayuda de los descubrimientos de Newton, se establecieron matemáticamente las leyes de los movimientos planetarios, ya postuladas por Jonaesh
Kepler, un astrólogo alemán (1609, 1619), y comenzó el estudio de los sistemas dinámicos. En el enfoque cualitativo, se podían explicar los comportamientos locales,
a largo plazo y asintóticos de una ecuación. Desafortunadamente, el estudio cualitativo se restringió exclusivamente a los matemáticos. Sin embargo, el poder y la
necesidad del enfoque cualitativo para analizar la evolución dinámica de un sistema fueron enriquecidos posteriormente por A. M. Lyapunov (1857-1918), G. D.
Birkhoff (1908-1944) y un grupo de matemáticos de las escuelas rusas, a saber, A. A. Andronov, V. I. Arnold y colaboradores (1937, 1966, 1971, 1973).</p>
<p>In fact, Poincaré studied continuous systems in connection with an international
competition held in honor of the 60th birthday of King Oscar II (1829–1907) of
Sweden and Norway. Of the four questions announced in the competition, he opted for
the stability of the solar system. He won the prize concluding that at least motions of
the sun, earth, and moon were stable. But the published memoir differed significantly
from the original due to an error. In the study of dynamics, he found it convenient to
replace a continuous flow of time with a discrete analogue. In Poincaré section orbits
may be analyzed through the set of points at which they pierce a two-dimensional
transverse surface. In celestial mechanics, Newton solved two-body problems: the
motion of the earth around the sun. This is the famous inverse-square law: F (gravitational force) ∝ (distance between two bodies). Many great mathematicians and
physicists tried to extend Newton’s analytical method to the three-body problem
(sun, earth, and moon), but three or more than three-body problems were found to
be remarkably difficult for finding solutions.</p>
<p>De hecho, Poincaré estudió sistemas continuos en relación con una competición internacional celebrada en honor del 60.º cumpleaños del rey Óscar II (1829-1907) de
Suecia y Noruega. De las cuatro preguntas anunciadas en la competición, optó por la estabilidad del sistema solar. Ganó el premio al concluir que al menos los
movimientos del Sol, la Tierra y la Luna eran estables. Pero las memorias publicadas diferían significativamente del original debido a un error. En el estudio de la
dinámica, le resultó conveniente sustituir un flujo continuo de tiempo por un análogo discreto. En la sección de Poincaré, las órbitas pueden analizarse a través
del conjunto de puntos en los que perforan una superficie transversal bidimensional. En mecánica celeste, Newton resolvió problemas de dos cuerpos: el movimiento de
la Tierra alrededor del Sol. Esta es la famosa ley del inverso del cuadrado: F (fuerza gravitacional) ∝ (distancia entre dos cuerpos). Muchos grandes matemáticos y
físicos intentaron extender el método analítico de Newton al problema de los tres cuerpos (Sol, Tierra y Luna), pero se descubrió que problemas con tres o más
cuerpos resultaban extraordinariamente difíciles de resolver.</p>
<p>At this juncture the situation seemed
completely hopeless. This means that instead of asking about the exact positions
of the planets always, one may ask ‘Is the solar system stable forever?’ Answering
this question for qualitative behavior of the system Poincaré devised a new way of
analysis which emphasized the qualitative approach. This eventually gave birth to the
subject of ‘Dynamical Systems’. The Russian Schools, viz. Mandelstam-Andronov
School, contributed immensely to the mathematical theories for dynamical systems
in the second half of the 1920s and in the 1930s. In the dynamic evolution stability of
a system is an important property. The Russian academician A. M. Lyapunov made
a significant contribution to the stability/instability of a system. The mathematical
definition of stability, construction of Lyapunov function, and Lyapunov theorem
are extensively used for analyzing the stability of a particular class of systems.
The Lyapunov exponent assuming the exponential growth/decay with time of nearby
orbits in statistical sense is applied for quantifying in chaotic motions. Also, Poincaré
conceived the idea that certain family of orbits lying on curves intersect infinitely
many times in the neighborhood of a point which instigates sensitivity with respect
to small changes in initial conditions of the system.</p>
<p>En esta coyuntura, la situación parecía completamente desesperada. Esto significa que, en lugar de preguntarnos siempre sobre las posiciones exactas de los
planetas, podríamos preguntarnos: “¿Es el sistema solar estable para siempre?”. Para responder a esta pregunta sobre el comportamiento cualitativo del sistema,
Poincaré ideó una nueva forma de análisis que enfatizaba el enfoque cualitativo. Esto finalmente dio origen al tema de los “Sistemas Dinámicos”. Las escuelas rusas,
a saber, la escuela Mandelstam-Andronov, contribuyeron enormemente a las teorías matemáticas para sistemas dinámicos en la segunda mitad de la década de 1920 y en
la de 1930. En la evolución dinámica, la estabilidad de un sistema es una propiedad importante. El académico ruso A. M. Lyapunov hizo una contribución significativa
a la estabilidad/inestabilidad de un sistema. La definición matemática de estabilidad, la construcción de la función de Lyapunov y el teorema de Lyapunov se
utilizan ampliamente para analizar la estabilidad de una clase particular de sistemas. El exponente de Lyapunov, que supone el crecimiento/decrecimiento exponencial
con el tiempo de las órbitas cercanas en sentido estadístico, se aplica para la cuantificación de movimientos caóticos. Además, Poincaré concibió la idea de que
ciertas familias de órbitas, situadas en curvas, se intersecan infinitas veces en las proximidades de un punto, lo que genera sensibilidad ante pequeños cambios en
las condiciones iniciales del sistema.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable breakthroughs in the early nineteenth century was
the discovery of solitary waves in a shallow water. Solitary waves are disturbances
occurring on the surface of a fluid. They are dispersive in nature and form a single
hump above the surface by displacing an equal amount of fluid, creating a bore
at the place. Furthermore, these waves spread while propagating without changing
their shape and velocity. The speed of these waves is proportional to depth of the
fluid that causes large amplitude of the wave. Consequently, the speed of the wave
increases with increase in the height of the wave. When a high amplitude solitary
wave is formed behind a low amplitude wave, the former overtakes the latter keeping
its shape unchanged with only a shift in position. This preservation of shape and
velocity after collision suggests a particle-like character of these waves and therefore
called as solitary wave or soliton, coined by Zabusky and Kruskal relevant with
photon, proton, etc. John Scott Russel, the Scottish naval engineer first observed
solitary wave on the Edinburgh–Glasgow canal in 1834 and he called it the ‘great
wave of translation’. Russel reported his observations to the British Association in
1844 as ‘Report on waves’. The mathematical form of these waves was given by
Boussinesq in 1871 and subsequently by Lord Rayleigh in 1876. The equation for
solitary wave was later derived by Korteweg and de Vries in 1895 and was popularly
known as the KdV equation. This is a nonlinear equation with a balance between
the nonlinear advection term and dispersion resulting in the propagation of solitary
waves in an inviscid fluid. However, the fluid viscosity dampens the nonlinear KdV
wave propagation in a viscous fluid.</p>
<p>Uno de los avances más notables de principios del siglo XIX fue el descubrimiento de las ondas solitarias en aguas someras. Las ondas solitarias son perturbaciones
que se producen en la superficie de un fluido. Son de naturaleza dispersiva y forman una única protuberancia sobre la superficie al desplazar una cantidad igual de
fluido, creando un agujero en el lugar. Además, estas ondas se propagan sin cambiar su forma ni velocidad. La velocidad de estas ondas es proporcional a la
profundidad del fluido, lo que provoca su gran amplitud. En consecuencia, la velocidad de la onda aumenta con el aumento de su altura. Cuando una onda solitaria de
gran amplitud se forma detrás de una onda de baja amplitud, la primera supera a la segunda, manteniendo su forma inalterada con solo un cambio de posición. Esta
preservación de la forma y velocidad después de la colisión sugiere un carácter de partícula de estas ondas y por lo tanto se denomina onda solitaria o solitón,
acuñado por Zabusky y Kruskal relevante con fotón, protón, etc. John Scott Russel, el ingeniero naval escocés observó por primera vez la onda solitaria en el canal
Edimburgo-Glasgow en 1834 y la llamó la “gran onda de traslación”. Russel reportó sus observaciones a la Asociación Británica en 1844 como “Informe sobre ondas”. La
forma matemática de estas ondas fue dada por Boussinesq en 1871 y posteriormente por Lord Rayleigh en 1876. La ecuación para la onda solitaria fue derivada
posteriormente por Korteweg y de Vries en 1895 y fue conocida popularmente como la ecuación KdV. Esta es una ecuación no lineal con un equilibrio entre el término
de advección no lineal y la dispersión resultando en la propagación de ondas solitarias en un fluido no viscoso. Sin embargo, la viscosidad del fluido amortigua la
propagación de la onda KdV no lineal en un fluido viscoso.</p>
<p>In the first half of the twentieth century nonlinear dynamics was mainly concerned
with nonlinear oscillations and their applications in physics, electrical circuits,
mechanical engineering, and biological science. Oscillations occur widely in nature
and are exploited in many manmade devices. Many great scientists, viz. van der Pol
(1889–1959), Alfred-Marie Liénard (1869–1958), Georg Duffing (1861–1944), John
Edensor Littlewood (1885–1977), A. A. Andronov (1901–1952), M. L. Cartwright
(1900–1998), N. Levinson (1912–1975), and others, made mathematical formula-
tions and analyzed different aspects of nonlinear oscillations. Balthasar van der Pol
had made significant contributions to areas such as limit cycles (isolated closed trajectory but neighboring trajectories are not closed either as they spiral toward the closed
trajectory or away from it, that is, cycles in limiting sense), relaxation oscillations
(limiting cycles exhibit an extremely slow buildup followed by a sudden discharge,
and then followed by another slow buildup and sudden discharge, and so on) of
nonlinear electrical circuits, forced oscillators, hysteresis (sudden jump behavior
which is completely different from original behavior) and bifurcation phenomena.
The well-known van der Pol equation first appeared in his paper entitled ‘On relaxation oscillations’ published in the Philosophical Magazine in the year 1926. The van
der Pol oscillator in a triode circuit is a simple example of a system with a limit cycle.
He and var der Mark used van der Pol nonlinear equation to describe the heartbeat
and an electrical model of the heart. Limit cycles were found later in mechanical
and biological systems. The existence of limit cycle, its uniqueness, and multiple
limit cycles of a system are important scientifically and stable limit cycle exhibits
self-sustained oscillations.</p>
<p>En la primera mitad del siglo XX, la dinámica no lineal se ocupó principalmente de las oscilaciones no lineales y sus aplicaciones en física, circuitos eléctricos,
ingeniería mecánica y ciencias biológicas. Las oscilaciones ocurren ampliamente en la naturaleza y se explotan en muchos dispositivos hechos por el hombre. Muchos
grandes científicos, a saber, van der Pol (1889-1959), Alfred-Marie Liénard (1869-1958), Georg Duffing (1861-1944), John Edensor Littlewood (1885-1977), A. A.
Andronov (1901-1952), M. L. Cartwright (1900-1998), N. Levinson (1912-1975) y otros, realizaron formulaciones matemáticas y analizaron diferentes aspectos de las
oscilaciones no lineales. Balthasar van der Pol realizó contribuciones significativas en áreas como los ciclos límite (trayectoria cerrada aislada, pero las
trayectorias vecinas no son cerradas, ya que giran en espiral hacia la trayectoria cerrada o se alejan de ella; es decir, ciclos en sentido límite), las
oscilaciones de relajación (los ciclos límite presentan una acumulación extremadamente lenta seguida de una descarga repentina, y luego otra acumulación lenta y una
descarga repentina, y así sucesivamente) de circuitos eléctricos no lineales, osciladores forzados, histéresis (comportamiento de salto repentino que es
completamente diferente del comportamiento original) y fenómenos de bifurcación. La conocida ecuación de van der Pol apareció por primera vez en su artículo
titulado “Sobre las oscilaciones de relajación”, publicado en la revista Philosophical Magazine en el año 1926. El oscilador de van der Pol en un circuito de triodo
es un ejemplo simple de un sistema con un ciclo límite. Él y var der Mark utilizaron la ecuación no lineal de van der Pol para describir el latido del corazón y un
modelo eléctrico del corazón. Los ciclos límite se encontraron más tarde en sistemas mecánicos y biológicos. La existencia del ciclo límite, su singularidad y los
múltiples ciclos límite de un sistema son importantes desde el punto de vista científico y un ciclo límite estable exhibe oscilaciones autosostenidas.</p>
<p>Species live in harmony in nature. The existence of one species depends on the
other; otherwise, one of the species would become extinct. Coexistence and sometimes mutual exclusion occur in reality in which one of the species becomes extinct.
Species may find themselves in competition for limited resources, whether food or
space. Mutualism is a mechanism where several species interact in a way that benefits each others. A real ecosystem may have hundreds or thousands of interacting
populations, with all sorts of direct and indirect interactions among them. Can such a
system of interacting populations show stability, periodic cycles and chaos, and if so,
under what circumstances? Alfred James Lotka (1880–1949), Vito Volterra (1860–1940), Ronald Fisher (1890–1962), Nicols Rashevsky (1899–1972), and many others
had explored the area of mathematical biology. The interaction dynamics of species,
its mathematical model, and their asymptotic behaviors are useful tools in population dynamics of interacting species. Interaction dynamics among species have a
great impact on the ecology and environment. The two-species predator–prey model
in which one species prey on another had been formulated by Lotka in 1910 and
later by Volterra in 1926. This is known as the Lotka–Volterra model taking linear
predator response function. In reality, the predator–prey populations rise and fall periodically and the maximum and minimum values (amplitudes) are relatively constant.</p>
<p>Las especies viven en armonía en la naturaleza. La existencia de una especie depende de la de la otra; de lo contrario, una de ellas se extinguiría. La
coexistencia, y en ocasiones la exclusión mutua, ocurren en la realidad, donde una de las especies se extingue. Las especies pueden encontrarse compitiendo por
recursos limitados, ya sea alimento o espacio. El mutualismo es un mecanismo en el que varias especies interactúan de forma que se benefician mutuamente. Un
ecosistema real puede tener cientos o miles de poblaciones interactuantes, con todo tipo de interacciones directas e indirectas entre ellas. ¿Puede un sistema de
poblaciones interactuantes mostrar estabilidad, ciclos periódicos y caos, y de ser así, bajo qué circunstancias? Alfred James Lotka (1880-1949), Vito Volterra
(1860-1940), Ronald Fisher (1890-1962), Nicols Rashevsky (1899-1972) y muchos otros exploraron el área de la biología matemática. La dinámica de interacción de las
especies, su modelo matemático y sus comportamientos asintóticos son herramientas útiles en la dinámica poblacional de las especies interactuantes. La dinámica de
interacción entre especies tiene un gran impacto en la ecología y el medio ambiente. El modelo depredador-presa de dos especies, en el que una especie se alimenta
de otra, fue formulado por Lotka en 1910 y posteriormente por Volterra en 1926. Este modelo, conocido como el modelo Lotka-Volterra, considera una función de
respuesta lineal al depredador. En realidad, las poblaciones depredador-presa aumentan y disminuyen periódicamente, y los valores máximos y mínimos (amplitudes) son
relativamente constantes.</p>
<p>However, this is not true for the Lotka–Volterra model. Different initial conditions can
have solutions with different amplitudes. So, this model is structurally unstable but
it has profound historical importance. On the other hand, Holling and Tanner (1975)
constructed a mathematical model for predator–prey populations whose solutions
have the same amplitudes in the long time irrespective of the initial populations.
Different types linear and nonlinear predator response functions, viz. Holling types
I, II, III, and IV, are designed for satisfying various behaviors of predator and prey
populations. The mathematical ecologist Robert May (1972) and many other scientists formulated several realistic population models that are useful in analyzing the
population dynamics.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, esto no se aplica al modelo de Lotka-Volterra. Diferentes condiciones iniciales pueden tener soluciones con diferentes amplitudes. Por lo tanto, este
modelo es estructuralmente inestable, pero tiene una profunda importancia histórica. Por otro lado, Holling y Tanner (1975) construyeron un modelo matemático para
poblaciones de depredador-presa cuyas soluciones tienen las mismas amplitudes a largo plazo, independientemente de las poblaciones iniciales. Diferentes tipos de
funciones de respuesta de depredador lineales y no lineales, a saber, los tipos Holling I, II, III y IV, están diseñados para satisfacer diversos comportamientos de
las poblaciones de depredadores y presas. El ecólogo matemático Robert May (1972) y muchos otros científicos formularon varios modelos poblacionales realistas que
son útiles para analizar la dinámica poblacional.</p>

The perception of unpredictability in natural and social phenomena has a great
impact on human thoughts and also in scientific evolutions. The conflict between determinism and freewill has been a long-standing continuing debate in philosophy.
Nature is our great teacher. In the nineteenth century, the French engineer Joseph
Fourier (1770–1830) wrote: ‘The study of Nature is the most productive source of
mathematical discoveries. By offering a specific objective, it provides the advantage
of excluding vague problems and unwieldy calculations. It is also a means to formulate mathematical analysis, and to isolate the most important aspects to know and to
conserve. These fundamental elements are those which appear in all natural effects’.
Models for physical phenomena are pitfalls and limitations. The true testament can
be made through observations and so is the mother of invention.</p>
<p>Newtonian mechanics gives us a deterministic view of an object in which the future
is determined by the laws of force and the initial conditions. There is no question of
unpredictability or freewill in the Newtonian setup. In the beginning of the twentieth
century experimental evidence, logical description, and also philosophical perception
of physical phenomena, both microscopic and macroscopic, made a breakthrough
in science as a whole. The perception of infinity, how we approach the stage of
infinitum, was a matter of great concern in the scientific community of the twentieth
century. In the macroscopic world, studies particularly in oscillations of electrical,
mechanical, and biological systems and the emergence of statistical mechanics either
in fluid system or material body established the role and consequence of nonlinearity
on their dynamics.</p>
<p>The existence of a chaotic orbit for a forced nonlinear van der Pol equation
was proved mathematically by M. L. Cartwright, J. E. Littlewood about the 1950s.
During this period, mathematician N. Levinson showed that a physical model had
a family of solutions that are unpredictable in nature. On the other hand, the turbulence in fluid flows is an unsolved and challenging problem in classical mechanics
even today. Turbulence problem is an interface between mathematics and physics.
The Soviet academician A. N. Kolmogorov (1903–1987), the greatest probabilist of
the twentieth century and his coworkers made seminal contributions to isotropic
turbulence in fluids, the famous Kolmogorov-5/3 law (K41 theory) in the statistical equilibrium range. Kolmogorov’s idea was based on the existence of statistical
equilibrium in homogeneous isotropic fluid turbulence, and turbulent flow quantities maintained complete self-similarities. In turbulent motion large unstable eddies
form and decay spontaneously into smaller unstable eddies, so that the energyeddies cascade continues until the eddies reach a size so small that the cascade
is damped effectively by fluid viscosity. Further, the energy-eddies cascade known
as the Richardson-Kolmogorov cascade proceed in a self-similar manner. Osborne
Reynolds (1842–1912), Geoffrey Ingram Taylor (1886–1975), von Karman (1881–
1963), and coworkers had made significant contributions to the statistical description
of turbulent motion. Yet, till today the nature of turbulent flow and universal law
remain elusive. The statistical formulation suffers from the ‘closure problem’ for
fluctuation components. Recent experimental and theoretical works on turbulence
revealed the existence of different nonequilibrium dissipation laws in some turbulent
flows, contrary to Kolmogorov equilibrium dissipation law. Also, theoretical studies
showed that there is some generality in turbulent dissipation relations and scaling
laws stemming from dilation symmetry groups of turbulent model equations.
In nonlinear dynamics the well-known Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM)
theorem proves the existence of a positive measure set of quasiperiodic motions lying
on invariant tori for Hamiltonian flows that are sufficiently close to completely inte-
grable systems. This is the condition of weak chaotic motion in conservative systems.</p>
<p>In chemistry, oscillation in chemical reaction such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reac-
tion provided a wonderful example of relaxation oscillation. The experiment was
conducted by the Russian biochemist Boris Belousov around the 1950s. However,
he could not publish his discovery as in those days it was believed that chemical
reagents must go monotonically to equilibrium solution, with no oscillatory motion.
Later, Zhabotinsky confirmed Belousov’s results and brought this discovery to the
notice of the scientific community at an international conference in Prague in the
year 1968. For the progress of nonlinear science in the twentieth century both in
theories and experiments such as hydrodynamic (water, helium, liquid mercury),
electronic, biological (heart muscles), chemical, etc., scientists believed that simple
looking systems can display highly complex seemingly random behavior. It was
Henri Poincaré who first reported the notion of sensitivity to initial conditions in
his work. The quotation from his essay on Science and Method is relevant here:
‘It may happen that small differences in the initial produce very great ones in the
final phenomena. A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the
later prediction becomes impossible’. Perhaps the most intriguing characteristic of
a chaotic system is the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Naturally, there is a
need to develop the science of the unpredictable. The real breakthrough came from
the computational result of a simple nonlinear system. In the year 1963, Edward
Lorenz (1917–2008) published a paper entitled ‘Deterministic Non-periodic Flow’.
In this paper he derived equations for thermal convection in a simplified model of
atmospheric flow and noticed a very strange thing that the solutions of the equations
would be unpredictable and irregular despite being a deterministic system. The sensi-
tive dependence of the evolution of a system for an infinitesimal change of initial
conditions is called the butterfly effects. Deterministic systems may exhibit a regular
behavior for some values of their control parameters and irregular behavior for other
values. Deterministic systems can give rise to motions that are essentially random
and the long-term prediction is impossible. Another paper from the discrete system
‘Differential Dynamical Systems’ published by Stephen Smale proved mathematically the existence of chaotic solutions and gave a geometric description of the chaotic
set, the cascading of Smale horseshoe map. Mathematicians/physicists such as Lev. D.
Laudau (transition scenario: laminar flow to turbulence), James Yorke (‘Period three
implies chaos’), Robert May (mathematical biology), Enrico Fermi (ergodicity),
Stanislaw Ulam (the growth of patterns in cellular automata, lattice dynamics), J. G.
Senai (ergodic theory), Sharkovskii (ordering of infinitely many periodic points of a
map of a line into itself), Ruelle and Takens scenario (laminar to turbulence through
quasiperiodic motions and ‘strange attractor’), A. Libchaber and J. Maurer (intermittency as a route to fluid turbulence) and many others are the great contributors to the
development of nonlinear science and chaos theory. In the mid-1970s, a remarkable
discovery was made by Mitchell Feigenbaum: the universality feature in transitional
route to chaos for quadratic unimodal maps undergoing period-doubling bifurcation
cascading. It maintained the monotonic sequence of period-doubling bifurcations as
Period-1 → Period-2 → Period-22 → ··· → Period-2n → ··· → Period-infinitum.</p>
<p>The successive bifurcations occur faster and faster with increasing growth parameter. This monotonic sequence has an accumulation point 3.57 approximately, above
which the formation of period-doubling cycles attain at critical boundary and chaos
through infinite number of period-doubling cascade comes into existence. Feigenbaum discovered the universal number 4.669201. On the other hand, there exists two
parameters dependent and anti-monotonicity process where the creation and annihilation of periodic orbits occur attaining the same period in a reverse way. This results
in creating of closed bubbles, known as periodic bubbles. The smaller and smaller
bubbles are generated and sandwiched in the original ones. The cascade continued
until chaos comes into existence. However, the convergence rate is slower than the
period-doubling process.</p>
<p>The power of fluctuations has got now recognition. The 2021 Nobel Prize in
physics has been awarded to Syukuro Manabe,Klaus Hasselmann, and Giorgio Parisi
for their contributions to our understanding of complex physical systems. The Nobel
Committee gave one-half of the prize money to Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann ‘for the physical modeling of earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reli-
ably predicting global warming’ and the other half to Giorgio Parisi ‘for the discovering of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic
to planetary scales’. The multiparameters dependent dynamics of nonlinear systems
showed some novel dynamical features that cannot occur in single-parameter models.
Several well-organized structures in chaotic regime, viz. the periodic Arnold tongue,
devil’s staircase, shrimp structure, periodic structures with period-adding sequences,
coexistence of multiple attractors, etc., have been observed in many systems. Specifically, the organized structures in bi-parameter plane for transitional and chaotic
regimes are active research interest for exploring novel features in dynamics. The
structures in chaotic motions have some special features like the scale invariance
property and universality character which are essential properties for understanding
the dynamics at all length scales. Further, in turbulent flow the organized structure is
developed. In the Kolmogorov equilibrium at inertial range the organized structure
‘the energy-eddies cascade’, known as Richardson-Kolmogorov cascade is developed at a sufficiently high Reynolds number for homogeneous isotropic turbulence.</p>
<p>In this range the turbulent kinetic energy is cascaded down from the larger to the
smaller scales. The concept of fractal geometry or fractal objects is about 50 years old and was
first introduced by the Polish–French–American mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot
(1924–2010) in 1975. Fractals are structures that are irregular, erratic, and self-
similarity is intrinsic in most of these objects. Fractal objects consist of self-similarity
between scales, that is, the patterns observed in larger scales repeat in ever decreasing
smaller and smaller scales. In short, a fractal object is made up of parts similar to
the whole in some way but lacks a characteristic smallest scale to measure. Fractal
geometry is different from Euclidean geometry and finds order in chaotic shapes
and processes. Chaotic orbit can be expressed in terms of fractal object. Scaling and
self-similarity are important features in most natural and manmade fractal objects
through scalings. The self-similarity and contractivity are two fundamental attributes
in fractal geometry. There exist numerous examples of fractals in natural and physical
sciences. One can also find a number of examples of fractals in the human anatomy.
For instance, lungs, heart, and many other anatomical structures are either fractal
or fractal-like. Moreover, in recent years the idea of fractals is being exploited to
find applications in medical science to curb fatal diseases. Mandelbrot and other
researchers have shown how fractals could be explored in different areas including
chaos and turbulence. There is an underlying structure to chaotic orbits, and the
connection between fractal and chaotic orbit is well-established now that help to
measure the loss of information in random motion. The phenomenon of chaos is a
realistic phenomenon and therefore one has to understand and realize chaos in usual
incidents happening in our everyday life. The study of chaotic phenomena has begun
in full length nowadays and is widely applied in different areas. The theory of chaos is
now applied in computer security, digital watermarking, secure data aggregation, and
video surveillance successfully. Thus, chaotic phenomena are not only destructive as
in tsunami, tornado, etc., but can also be effectively utilized for the welfare of human
beings. Chaos has been considered as the third greatest discovery, after relativity
and quantum mechanics in the twentieth century science and philosophy. In the past
20 years scientists and technologists have been realizing the potential use of chaos
in natural and technological sciences.</p>
<p>1.2 Dynamical Systems</p>
<p>Dynamics is primarily the study of the time-evolutionary process, and the corresponding system of equations is known as dynamical system. Generally, a system
of n first-order differential equations in the space Rn is called a dynamical system
of dimension n which determines the time behavior of evolutionary process. Evolu-
tionary processes may possess the properties of determinacy/non-determinacy, finite/
infinite dimensionality, and differentiability. A process is called deterministic if
its entire future course and its entire past are uniquely determined by its state at
the present time. Otherwise, the process is called nondeterministic. However, the
process may be semi-deterministic (determined, but not uniquely). In classical
mechanics the motion of a system whose future and past are uniquely determined
by the initial positions and the initial velocities is an example of a deterministic
dynamical system. The evolutionary process may describe, viz. (i) a continuous-time
process and (ii) a discrete-time process. The continuous-time process is represented
by differential equations, whereas the discrete-time process is by difference equations
(or maps). The continuous-time dynamical systems may be described mathematically
as follows:</p>
<p>Let x∼ = x∼(t) ∈ Rn, t ∈ I ⊆ R be the vector representing the dynamics of a
continuous system (continuous-time system). The mathematical representation of
the system may be written as</p>
<p>d x
∼
dt
=  ̇x
∼ = f
∼
(x
∼
, t), (1.1)</p>
<p>where f∼(x∼, t) is a sufficiently smooth function defined on some subset U ⊂ Rn ×R.</p>
<p>Schematically, this can be shown as</p>
<p>Rn
(state space)
× R
(time)
= Rn+1
(space of motions)
.</p>
<p>The variable t is usually interpreted as time and the function f∼(x∼, t) is generally
nonlinear. The time interval may be finite, semi-finite, or infinite. The function f
∼(x∼, t) may involve with parameters and the system is x ̇ = f∼(x∼, c∼, t), c
∼ ∈ Rm. On the othehand, the discrete system is related to a discrete map (given only at equally spaced
points of time) such that from a point x0, one can obtain a point x1 which in turn
maps into x2, and so on. In other words, xn+1 = g(xn) = g(g(xn−1)), etc. This is
also written in the form xn+1 = g(xn) = g2(xn−1) = ··· . The discrete system will
be discussed in the later chapters.</p>
<p>If the right-hand side of Eq. (1.1) is explicitly time independent, then the system is
called autonomous. The trajectories of such a system do not change in time. On the
other hand, if the right-hand side of Eq. (1.1) has explicit dependence on time then
the system is called nonautonomous. An n-dimensional nonautonomous system can
be converted into autonomous form by introducing a new dependent variable xn+1
such that xn+1 = t. In general, the solution of Eq. (1.1) is difficult or sometimes
impossible to obtain when the function f∼(x∼, t) is nonlinear, except in some special
cases. Examples of autonomous and nonautonomous systems are given below.</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">

<p>(a) x  ̈ + αx  ̇ + βx = 0, α, β &gt; 0. This is a damped linear harmonic oscillator.
The parameters α and β are respectively, the strength of damping and the
strength of linear restoring force. For α /= 0 the system has a point attractor.
It exhibits periodic motion for α = 0, the no damping case.</p>
<p>(b) x ̈+ω2 sin x = 0,ω = √g/L. g is the gravitational acceleration, and L is the

It has interesting dynamics to be explored.</p>
<p>(c) x  ̇ = αx − βxyy  ̇ = −γ y + δxy. This is the well-known Lotka–Volterra simple
predator–prey model, where α, β, γ, δ are all positive constants. The terms
βxy and δxy are interactions among preys and predators. This nonlinear
system shows periodic cycle for specific ranges of parameter values.</p>
<p>(d) x  ̈ − μ(1 − x 2)x  ̇ + βx = 0, μ &gt; 0. This is the well-known van der Pol
nonlinear oscillator, which gives unique stable limit cycle (regular attractor)
surrounding the origin for small value of μ. This limiting periodic motion
has a special physical significance in diode electrical circuits. Physically,
there is a balance among the source of energy, that is, a DC voltage, the
source of dissipation, and the restraining forces for the existence of limit
cycle. However, it exhibits the relaxation oscillator for large values of μ.</p>

<p>(a) x  ̈ + αx  ̇ + βx = f cos ωt, α, β &gt; 0. This is an example of linear oscil-
lator with external time-dependent force. The parameters f and ω are the
amplitude and frequency of driving force, respectively.</p>
<p>(b) x  ̈ + αx  ̇ + ω2 0 x + βx 3 = f cos ωt. This is a G. Duffing nonlinear oscillator
who studied it in 1930s. It has a cubic restoring force and harmonic forcing.
The parameter α is the strength of damping, ω0 the natural frequency and

<p>(c) x  ̈ − μ(1 − x 2)x  ̇ + βx = f cos ωt, μ &gt; 0. This is a van der Pol nonlinear
forced oscillator exhibiting nonlinear oscillations. A linear oscillator shows
multiples of base frequency representing multiplicative dynamics while
this nonlinear oscillator with forced periodic driving exhibits submul-
tiples of the base frequency ω0, that is, ω02 , ω03 ,…, ω0n . In addition to
subharmonics, higher harmonics of mω0 n (m, n = 1, 2, 3, …) appear with
increasing of periodic driving voltage. Subharmonics play a vital role in
creating prechaotic vibrations. The subharmonic frequencies develop an
irregular noise with frequency demultiplications. The noise occurs when
the frequency jumps to the next lower frequency. This phenomenon is one
of the first evidence of chaos and implies that chaotic motion occurs in a
system intrinsically. There are many stories and myths on nonlinear oscil-
lations before 1960s when people did not believe the existence of chaotic
motions and its several implications. Researchers find how chaos theory
could explore a new answer to Einstein’s famous question: ‘Does God play
dice in nature?’ in case of macroscopic dynamics. Note that the famous
‘Japanese Attractor’ corresponding to Duffing equation applicable to an
electrical circuit with nonlinear inductor had not been recognized until
1978. It was discovered by Professor Yoshisake Ueda of Kyoto University.
Instead of a closed Poincare‘ section, he obtained a ragged picture and
called it a ‘shattered egg’. With the advancement of nonlinear dynamics
and its mathematical theory the intermittent oscillations and chaotic noise
are now recognized in engineering devices and physical processes.</p>
<p>(d) x  ̈ − μ(1 − x 2)x  ̇ + ω20 x + βx 3 = f cos ωt. This is a Duffing-van der Pol
nonlinear equation with a cubic nonlinearity and harmonic forcing. The
system exhibits many interesting phenomena.</p>
<p>Some distinct properties of linear and nonlinear systems as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Superposition principle: This holds good for linear systems and solutions constitute a linear space. Consider a linear equation x  ̈ + x = 0, x ≡ x(t). It has two
linearly independent solutions, viz.sin(t) and cos(t). The general solution is
expressed by x(t) = A cos(t) + B sin(t) which is a linear combination of two
solutions and A, B are arbitrary constants. So, the linear differential operator
L : C(R) → C(R), the collection of all real-valued continuous functions such
that Lx = 0, L = ddt 2 +1 holds the relation L(Ax1+ Bx2) = AL x1+ BL x2 for
two solutions. This is the linearity principle. Now, consider a nonlinear equation
x  ̈ + x + εx 3 = 0. We examine now the principle of superposition as given by
L(Ax1 + Bx2) = AL x1 + BL x2 +ε[L(Ax1 + Bx2)3 −(Ax 31 + Bx 32 )] implying
that L(Ax1 + Bx2) /= AL x1 + BL x2. The principle of superposition does
not hold for nonlinear equations. The conclusion is that the notion of linearly
independent solutions for nonlinear systems loses its meaning.</p>
<p>(b) Dependence on integration constants and /or initial conditions of nonlinear
systems: The dependences of solution on the initial/integration constants are
related generally in the form of their linear combinations for linear equation.
This is not true for nonlinear systems in general. Consider a nonlinear equation,
x x  ̈ +  ̇x 2 = 0 ⇒ ddt (x x ̇) = 0 ⇒ x x  ̇ = A say. So, x dx = Adt ⇒ x 2 =
2At + 2B ⇒ x = ±√2At + 2B. The conclusion is that the dependence on the
two integration constants A and B is connected nonlinearly. Again, we consider
x  ̇ = f (x) = 1 + x 2 with x(0) = 0. f (x) is continuous in the real line, and so
solution exists. The solution is given by x(t) = tan(t). However, the solutions
are blown up infinity at t = ± π/2. It indicates the fact that solutions are not
always valid for all time even though the solution exists.</p>
<p>(c) Frequency multiplication-higher harmonics, subharmonics, sustained and relax-
ation oscillations, chaotic noise, etc.: Oscillation is an important phenomenon
that exhibits in many physical processes. It revolutionized in 1920–1940 for
discoveries of different electrical and electronic devices in particular the diode,
triode, and transistors. The second- and higher-order systems exhibit oscillations. Linear oscillators are not structurally stable depending upon initial condi-
tions and amplitude, and so engineers were tried to design nonlinear oscillators which are structurally stable, robust and the amplitude of oscillation at
steady state is independent of initial conditions. The nonlinear equations have
an intrinsic tendency to multiply frequencies resulting multiplicative dynamics
and they may have a family of solutions. The multiples frequencies appear
depending on the nature of nonlinearity. Apart from these properties nonlinear
systems exhibit bi-stability (two states), sustained oscillation, relaxation oscillation, hysteresis (a sudden jump phenomenon observed in many mechanical and
electrical systems), coexistence of quasiperiodic motions and phase-locking,
existence of unique or multiple limit cycles, coexistence of multiple attrac-
tors, creating noise, random and unpredictable dynamics. These are appeared
intrinsically in nonlinear systems.</p>
<p>Some Examples of Dynamical Systems</p>
<p>(a) The most common example of a deterministic dynamical system is Newtonian
systems governed by Newton’s law of motion. This law states that the acceler-
ation of a particle is determined by the force per unit mass. The force can be a
function of the velocity (x ̇) and the position (x), and so the Newtonian systems
take the form</p>
<p>m x  ̈ = F(x, x ̇), (m = mass, F = force). (1.2)</p>
<p>Equation (1.2) may be written as a system of two first-order differential equations
as</p>
<p>x  ̇ = y, and y  ̇ = F(x, y). (1.3)</p>
<p>System (1.3) may be viewed as a dynamical system of dimension two in the
xy-plane and the dynamics is a set of trajectories giving time evolution of motion.</p>
<p>(b) The simple exponential growth model for a single population is expressed
mathematically as</p>
<p>dx
dt = rx with x = x0 at t = 0, (1.4)</p>
<p>where r &gt; 0 is the population growth parameter. The solution of (1.4) is
x(t) = x0ert . This solution expresses the simplest model for population growth
with time in unrestricted resources and the population x(t) → ∞ as t → ∞.
Obviously, this model does not obey realistic population growth of any species.</p>
<p>The simple population growth model, considering effects like intraspecies compe-
titions, depletion of resources with population growth, and sudden emergence of
infectious disease is given as</p>
<p>dx
dt = (r − bx)x (1.5)</p>
<p>with the condition x = x0 at t = 0. The solution of (1.5) is given as</p>
<p>x(t) =
( r
b
)
x0
x0 + ( r
b − x0
)
e−rt . (1.6)</p>
<p>Clearly x → r b as t → ∞ for both the cases x0 &gt; r
b and x0 &lt; r b . In this model a linear decrease growth with the population is considered.</p>
<p>This growth model is known as the logistic growth model of population. The
graphical representation of the above solution is shown in Fig. 1.1.</p>
<p>This simple model shows that population x(t) is of constant growth rate after
some time t.</p>
<p>(c) Populations of two competing species (predator and prey populations) could be
modeled mathematically. The predator–prey populations model was first formu-
lated by Alfred J. Lotka (1880–1949) in the year 1910 and later by Vito Volterra
(1860–1940) in the year 1926. This is known as Lotka–Volterra predator–prey
model. The idea of constructing this model came from observing fish popula-
tions when fishing was mostly suspended during the First World War. An Italian
marine biologist Umberto D’Ancona noticed in the mid-1920s that the relative
frequency of some fish species were increased and decreased in the relative
frequency of other species by performing a statistical analysis. He posed the
distinct patterns in fish populations to Luisa Volterra, an ecologist and then to
Vito Volterra, a mathematician. As a result, the Lotka-Volterra model for preda-
tors and preys in fish populations was emerged. Here we demonstrate another
two interacting populations viz., Fox and Rabbit populations. In the model the
foxes prey on rabbits. The population density of rabbit affects the population
density of fox, since the latter relies on the former for food. If the density of rabbit
is high, the fox population decreases, while when the fox population increases,
the rabbit population decreases. When the rabbit population falls, the fox population also falls. When the fox population drops, the rabbits can multiply again
and so on. The growth or decrease of two populations could be analyzed using
dynamical system principles. The dynamical equations for predator–prey model
are given as</p>
<p>x  ̇ = αx − βxy
y  ̇ = −γ y + δxy)</p>
<p>, (1.7)</p>
<p>where x denotes the population density of the prey and y, the population density
of the predator. The parameter α represents the growth rate of the prey in the
absence of intersection with the predators whereas the parameter γ represents
the death rate of the predators in the absence of interaction with the prey and β,
δ are the interaction parameters and are all constants (for simple model). Using
the dynamical principle one can obtain a necessary condition for coexistence
of the two species. In this model the survival of the predators depends entirely
on the population of the prey. If initially x = 0, then y  ̇ = −γ y, that is, y(t) =
y(0)e−γ t and y(t) → 0 as t → ∞, Arrowsmith and Place [1]. However, the
Lotka-Volterra model is structurally unstable but it has historical interest.</p>
<p>In the development of mathematical biology, people begin to pay more attention
for studying discrete predator–prey model. Sometimes it shows richer and more
complex dynamics than the corresponding continuous model. The general discrete
predator–prey interacting model is of the form in the (n + 1)th generation, Ren et al.
[2]</p>
<p>(
x(n + 1) = x(n) + r x(n)(1 − x(n)) − p1(x(n), y(n))y(n),
y(n + 1) = y(n) + sy(n) + p2(x(n), y(n))y(n).</p>
<p>The term r x(n)(1 − x(n)) represents the logistic growth of prey population in
the absence of predator and the parameter r is the intrinsic growth rate of prey. s
represents the death rate or intrinsic growth rate of predator. Due to interdependency
of two interacting populations, the model can be classified into the following types:</p>
<p>(i) General predator–prey model: In this model, the parameter s is considered the
death rate of predator (s &lt; 0), p1 = p2 &gt; 0 is the predator response func-
tions. The response functions are referred to the change in the density of prey
population per unit time.</p>
<p>(ii) Leslie–Gower predator–prey model: Here s denotes the intrinsic growth rate of
predator (s &gt; 0), p1 is predator response function, p2 = −y/(γ x), y/(γ x)
is called Leslie–Gower term in the model. So, for x /= 0, and y(n + 1) =
y(n) + sy(n)[1 − sy(n)/((γ s)x(n))].</p>
<p>Where (γ s)is a measure of food quantity of prey for conversion into predator growth
depending on the density of the prey population. Notably, predator grows logistically
with intrinsic growth rate s with carrying capacity proportional to the population size
of prey.</p>
<p>Different types response functions are designed depending upon predator and
prey populations and their interacting strategies. The Holling type-I response func-
tion is represented by p1(x, y) = m x. The linear function p1(x, y) is replaced by
(mx/(q + x)), which is Holling type-II functional response, that is, concave upward
curve with saturation level, and the Holling type-III is p1(x, y) = mx 2/(x 2 + b2),
which is a sigmoid-shaped curve. The type-IV is represented by p1(x, y) =
mx/(qx + ry + s), which is nonmonotonic curve with first part increasing and the
last part decreasing. Among these the Holling type-II is used widely. However, all
response functions are involved various parameters and are required suitable values.
These response functions are designed for representing different types of predator’s
behavior and interacting capacity for preying. The complexity of interactions among
populations shows that the functional responses depend not only on prey but also on
predator. In the study of dragonfly, Crowley and Martin [3] showed that the feeding
rates of the second-year class larvae are connected with their own density and also
the density of their first-year class conspecific prey, and the functional response is
represented by</p>
<p>p1(x, y) = mx/[(1 + ax)(1 + bx)],</p>
<p>where m, a, b &gt; 0 represent the effects of capture rate, handling time, and the
magnitude of interference among predators. In this model, the study shows that
predator feeding rate decreases with higher predator density even when prey density
is high. The intra-specific interference should generally increase in intensity with
increasing population density. In spite of these effects there creates psychological
stress on prey population due to the mere presence of predators. The predator has
a twofold impact on prey population, viz. (i) the predators physically attack and
kill their preys and thereby reduce their number, and (ii) they hold the power of
putting the prey individuals in a state of psychological state. Also, there are various
kinds cooperation hunting strategies among predators for capturing preys efficiently,
different types of harvesting, viz. constant rate, linear, or proportional harvesting and
nonlinear harvesting. The impacts on prey–predator models under direct and indirect
effects will discuss in later chapters.</p>
<p>(d) Suppose we have an LCR circuit consisting of a resistor of resistance R,a
capacitor of capacitanceC, and an inductor of inductance L. In a simple electrical
circuit, the values of R, C, and L are always nonnegative and are independent of
time t. Kirchhoff’s current law (the sum of the currents flowing into a node is
equal to the sum of the currents flowing out of it) is satisfied if we pass a current
I to the closed loop as shown in Fig. 1.2.</p>
<p>According to Kirchhoff’s voltage law of the circuit (the sum of the potential
differences around any closed loop in a circuit is zero), we have the equation</p>
<p>V12 + V23 + V31 = 0. (1.8)</p>
<p>Here Vij denotes the voltage difference between node i and node j.</p>
<p>From Ohm’s law, we get the relation</p>
<p>V31 = IR. (1.9)</p>
<p>Also, from the definition of capacitance C, we have</p>
<p>C
dV12
dt = I. (1.10)</p>
<p>Again, Faraday’s law of inductance gives</p>
<p>L
dI
dt = V23. (1.11)</p>
<p>Substituting (1.8) and (1.10) into (1.11) and writing V12 = V , we get</p>
<p>dI
dt = − R
L
I − V
L . (1.12)</p>
<p>From (1.10) and (1.12) we finally obtain</p>
<p>dV

and

L
I − V
L . (1.13)</p>
<p>These equations represent a dynamical system of dimension two in the V −I plane.
This is a simple linear model in LCR circuit. The linear models have undoubtedly
had good success, but they also have limitations. Linear models can only produce
persistent oscillations of a harmonic (trigonometric) type.</p>
<p>A circuit is called nonlinear when it contains at least one nonlinear circuit element
like a nonlinear resistor, a nonlinear capacitor or a nonlinear inductor. Chua’s diode
model system is a simple example of nonlinear electric circuit represented by x  ̇ =
c1(y − x − f (x)), y  ̇ = c2(x − y + z),z  ̇ = −c3 y where f (x) = m1x + ((m0 −
m1)/2)(<a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">|x + 1|−|x − 1|</span></a>) satisfying two parameters m0 &lt; −1 &lt; m1. It represents
three different voltage-current regimes in the diode circuit and is only nonlinear term
in the equation. The function f (x) is piecewise linear and gives nonlinear effects
in the circuit, see Lakshmanan and Rajasekar [4] for different nonlinear electrical
circuits. However, the function is not differentiable at x=-1 and x=1. The above
Chua’s model equations exhibit double scroll chaos through period-doubling cascade.</p>
<p>1.3 Flows</p>
<p>The time-evolutionary process may be described as a flow of a vector field in Rn.
Solutions are curves in an open set U subset of Rn which are tangent to this vector
field at each point. Generally, flow is frequently used for discussing the dynamics
as a whole rather than the evolution of a system at a particular point. The solution
x∼(t) of a system x ̇∼ = f∼(x∼) which satisfies x∼(t0) = x∼ 0 gives the past (t &lt; t0) and
future (t &gt; t0) evolutions of the system. Mathematically, the flow is defined by
φt (x∼) : U → Rn where φt (x∼) = φ(t, x∼) is a smooth vector function of x
∼ ∈ U ⊆ Rnand t ∈ I ⊆ R satisfying the equation</p>
<p>d

φt (x

) = f

(φt (x

))</p>
<p>for all t such that the solution through x∼ exists and φ(0, x
∼) = x∼. The flow φt (x∼) satisfies the following properties:</p>

<li><p>φo = Id , (b) φt+s = φt ◦ φs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some flows may also satisfy the property</p>
<p>φ(t + s, x
∼
) = φ(t,φ(s, x

).</p>
<p>Flows in R : Consider a one-dimensional autonomous system represented by
x  ̇ = f (x), x ∈ R. We can imagine that a fluid is flowing along the real line with
local velocity f (x). This imaginary fluid is called the phase fluid, and the real line is
called the phase line. It specifies the state of the system as time goes on. For solution
of the system x  ̇ = f (x) starting from an arbitrary initial position x0, we place an
imaginary particle, called a phase point, at x0 and watch how it moves along with
the flow in phase line in varying time t. As time goes on, the phase point (x, t) in the
one-dimensional system x  ̇ = f (x) with x(0) = x0 moves along the x-axis according
to some function φ(t, x0). The function φ(t, x0) is called the trajectory for a given
initial state x0, and the set {φ(t, x0)|t ∈ I ⊆ R} is the orbit of x0 ∈ R. The set of all
qualitative trajectories of the system is called phase portrait.</p>
<p>Flows in R 2 : Consider a two-dimensional system represented by the following
equations x  ̇ = f (x, y), y  ̇ = g(x, y), (x, y) ∈ R2. An imaginary fluid particle
flows in the plane R2, known as phase plane of the system. The succession of states
given parametrically by x = x(t), y = y(t) trace out a curve through some initial
point P(x(t0), y(t0)) is called a phase path. The set {φ(t, x∼ 0)|t ∈ I ⊆ R} is the
orbit of x ∼ 0 in R2. There are an infinite number of trajectories that would fill the
phase plane when they are plotted. But the qualitative behavior can be determined
by plotting a few trajectories with different initial conditions. The phase portrait
displays how the qualitative behavior of a system is changing as x and y vary with
time t. An orbit is called periodic if x(t + p) = x(t) for some p &gt; 0, for all t. The
smallest integer p for which the relation is satisfied is called the prime period of the
orbit. Flows in R cannot have oscillatory or closed path.</p>
<p>Flows in Rn: Let us now define an autonomous system representing n ordinary
differential equations as</p>
<p>x ̇1 = f1(x1, x2,…, xn)
x ̇2 = f2(x1, x2,…, xn)
.
.
.
x ̇n = fn(x1, x2,…, xn)
⎫
⎪⎪⎪⎬
⎪⎪⎪⎭</p>
<p>which can also be written in symbolic notation as x ̇∼ = f∼(x∼), where x∼ =(x1, x2,…, xn) and f
∼= ( f1, f2,…, fn). The solution of this system with the initial condition x
∼(0) = x∼ 0 can be thought as a continuous curve in the phase space
Rn parameterized by time t ∈ I ⊆ R. So the set of all states of the evolutionary
process is represented by an n-valued vector field in Rn. The solutions of the system
with different initial conditions describe a family of phase curves in the phase space,
called the phase portrait of the system. The vector field f
∼(x∼) is everywhere tangent to these curves, and their orientation is directed by the direction of the tangent vector
of f∼(x∼).</p>
<p>A family of maps φt : X → X for t ≥ 0 such that φ0 = Id and φt+s = φt ◦ φs for
every t,s ≥ 0 is called a semi-flow. On the other hand, a family of maps φt : X → X
for t ∈ R such that φ0 = Id and φt+s = φt ◦ φs for every t,s ∈ R is called a flow.</p>
<p>Also, we say that a family of maps φt represents a dynamical system if it is a flow
or semi-flow. Note that if a family of maps generates a flow, then
φt ◦ φ−t = φ−t ◦ φt and φ0 = Id so that each map φt is invertible and its inverse
is given by φ−1
t = φ−t .</p>
<p>For example, any movement by translation is a flow with constant velocity. It
is expressed as φt : Rn → Rn such that φt (x) = x + ty, t ∈ R,x, y ∈ Rn,
that is, a flow generated by translation with constant velocity. Now, φ0 = Id and
φt+s(x) = x + (t + s)y = (x + sy) + ty = φt ◦ φs(x). Hence, the family of maps
φt generates a flow.</p>
<p>1.4 Evolution</p>
<p>Consider a system x ̇∼ = f∼(x∼), x∼ ∈ Rn with initial conditions x
∼ (t0) = x ∼ 0. Let E ⊂ Rn be an open set and f∼∈ C1(E). For x
∼ 0 ∈ E, let φ(t, ∼ 0) be a solution of
the above system on the maximum interval of existence I(x∼ 0) ⊂ R. The mapping
φt : Rn → Rn defined by φt (x∼ 0) = φ(t, x∼ 0) is known as evolution operator of
the system. The linear flow for the system x ̇∼ = A x∼ with x
∼(t0) = x∼ 0, is defined byφt : Rn → Rn and φt = eAt , the exponential matrix. The mappings φt for both linear
and nonlinear systems satisfy the following properties:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>φ0(x) = x</p></li>
<li><p>φs(φt (x∼)) = φs+t (x∼), ∀s, t ∈ R.</p></li>
<li><p>φt (φ−t (x∼)) = φ−t (φt (x∼)) = x∼, ∀t ∈ R.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In general, a dynamical system may be viewed as group of nonlinear / linear oper-
ators evolving as {φt (x∼), t ∈ R, x∼ ∈ Rn}. The following dynamical group properties
hold good:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>φt φs ∈ {φt (x∼), t ∈ R, x∼ ∈ Rn} (closure property).</p></li>
<li><p>φt (φsφr ) = (φt φs)φr (associative property).</p></li>
<li><p>φ0(x∼) = x∼, φ0 being the identity operator.</p></li>
<li><p>φt φ−t = φ−t φt = φ0, where φ−t is the inverse of φt .</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For some cases the flow satisfies the commutative property φt φs = φsφt .</p>
<p>1.5 Fixed Points of a System</p>
<p>The notion of a fixed point is important in analyzing the local and global behaviors
of a system. The fixed point is nothing but a constant or equilibrium or invariant
solution of a system. A point is a fixed point of the flow generated by an autonomous
system x ̇∼ = f∼(x∼), x∼ ∈ Rn if and only if the flow satisfies φ(t, x
∼) = x∼ for all t ∈ R.This gives ddt φ(t, x) =  ̇x∼ = 0∼ ⇒ f
∼(x∼) = 0 for fixed points. For nonautonomous
systems fixed point can be defined for a fixed time interval. A fixed point is also
known as a critical point or an equilibrium point or a stationary point. This point
is also called stagnation point with respect to the flow φt in Rn. Flows on line may
have no fixed points, only one fixed point, finite number of fixed points, and infinite
number of fixed points. For example, the flow x  ̇ = 5 (no fixed points), x  ̇ = x (only
one fixed point), x  ̇ = x 2 − 1 (two fixed points), and x  ̇ = sin x (infinite number of
fixed points on the real line).</p>
<p>1.6 Linear Stability Analysis</p>
<p>A fixed point, say x∼0is said to be stable if for a given ε &gt; 0, there exists a δ &gt; 0
depending upon ε such that for all t ≥ t0, || x∼(t) − x∼0(t)|| &lt; ε, whenever || x
∼(t0) −x∼0(t)|| &lt; δ, where ||.|| : Rn → R denotes the norm of a vector in Rn. Otherwise, the
fixed point is called unstable. In linear stability analysis the quadratic and higher-
order terms in the Taylor series expansion about a fixed point x∗ of a system x  ̇ =
f (x), x ∈ R are neglected due to the smallness of the terms. Consider a small
perturbation quantity ξ(t), away from the fixed point x∗, such that x(t) = x∗ +ξ(t).
We see whether the perturbation grows or decays as time goes on. So, we get the
perturbation equation as</p>
<p>ξ ̇ =  ̇x = f (x) = f (x∗ + ξ ).</p>
<p>Taylor series expansion of f (x∗ + ξ ) gives</p>
<p>ξ ̇ = f (x∗) + ξ f ‘
(x∗) + ξ 2
2 f ‘’(x∗) + ··· .</p>
<p>According to linear stability analysis, we get</p>
<p>ξ ̇ = ξ f ‘
(x∗) [∵ f (x∗) = 0].</p>
<p>Assuming f ‘(x∗) /= 0, the perturbation ξ(t) grows exponentially if f ‘
(x∗) &gt; 0 and decays exponentially if f ‘ (x∗) &lt; 0. Linear theory fails if f ‘
(x∗) = 0 and then higher-order derivatives must be considered in the neighborhood of fixed point for
stability analysis of the system.</p>
<p>Example 1.1 Find the evolution operator φt for the one-dimensional flow x  ̇ = −x 2.
Show that φt forms a dynamical group. Is it a commutative group?</p>
<p>Solution The solutions of the given system are obtained as below:</p>
<p>x  ̇ = dx
dt = −x 2 ⇒
1
x = t + A ⇒ x(t) = 1
t + A</p>
<p>in any interval of R that does not contain the point x = 0, where A is a constant.</p>
<p>If we take starting point x(0) = x0, then A = 1/x0 and so we get</p>
<p>x(t) = x0
1 + x0t
, t /= −1/x0.</p>
<p>The point x = 0 is not included in this solution. But it is the fixed point of the
given system, because x  ̇ = 0 ⇔ x = 0. Therefore, φt (0) = 0 for all t ∈ R. So the
evolution operator of the system is given as φt (x) = x1+xt for allx ∈ R.</p>
<p>The evolution operator φt is not defined for all t ∈ R. For example, if t =
−1/x, x /= 0, then φt is undefined. Thus, we see that the interval in which φt is
defined is completely dependent on x.</p>
<p>We shall now examine the group properties of the evolution operator φt below:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>φr φs ∈ {φt (x), t ∈ R, x ∈ R}∀r,s ∈ R (closure property)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>φr (y) = y
1 + yr . Take y = x
1 + xs</p>
<p>= x/1 + sx
1 + xr
1+xs
= x
1 + xs + xr = x
1 + x(s + r )
= φs+r ∈ {φt (x), t ∈ R, x ∈ R}.
(ii) φt (φsφr ) = (φt φs)φr (associative property)
L.H.S. = φt ((φsφr )(x)) = φt (y) = y
1 + yt = z
1 + zs</p>
<p>= x
1 + x(r + s)</p>
<p>, y = φs(φr (x))
(where y = φs(z),z = φr (x) = x
1 + r x )</p>
<p>∴ L.H.S. = x</p>
<p>1 + x(t + r + s) = φt+r+s(x)
RH.S. = ((φt φs)φr (x)) = φt+s+r (x) = x
1 + x(t + s + r )</p>
<p>Hence, φt (φsφr )(x) = (φsφr )φt (x), ∀x ∈ R.</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple" start="3">
<li><p>φ0(x) = x 1+x·0 = x, φ0 is the identity operator.</p></li>
<li><p>φt φ−t (x) = φt (y) = y</p></li>
</ol>
<p>1 + ty , y = φ−t (x) = x
1 − tx</p>
<p>= x
1 − tx + tx = x = φ0(x) (φ−t is the inverse ofφt ).</p>
<p>Hence the flow evolution operator forms a dynamical group.</p>
<p>(v) φt φs = φsφt ,
(φt φs)(x) = φt (y) = y</p>
<p>1 + ty , y = φs(x) = x
1 + xs</p>
<p>= x
1 + x(t + s) = φt+s(x)
φsφt (x) = φs+t (x) = x
1 + (s + t)x</p>
<p>So, φt φs = φsφt (Commutative property). Thus, the evolution operator φt forms
a commutative group.</p>
<p>Example 1.2 Find the evolution operator φt for the system x  ̇ = x 2 − 1 and also
verify that φt (φs(x)) = φt+s(x) for all s, t ∈ R. Show that the evolution operator
forms a dynamical group. Examine whether it is commutative dynamical group.</p>
<p>Solution Same as Example 1.1.</p>
<p>Example 1.3 Find the maximal interval of existence for unique solution of the
following systems</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>x ̇(t) = x 2 + cos2 t, t &gt; 0, x(0) = 0</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(ii) x  ̇ = x 2
, x(0) = 1.</p>
<p>Solution (i) By maximal interval of existence of solution we mean the largest
interval for which the solution of the equation exists. The given system is
nonautonomous and f (t, x) = x 2 + cos2 t. Consider the rectangle R =
{(t, x) : 0 ≤ t ≤ a, <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">|x|</span></a> ≤ b, a &gt; 0, b &gt; 0} containing the point (0, 0). Clearly,
f (t, x) is continuous and ∂ f∂x = 2x is bounded on R. The Lipschitz condi-
tion | f (t, x1) − f (t, x2)| ≤ K|x1 − x2|, ∀(t, x1),(t, x2) ∈ R, K being the Lips-
chitz constant, is satisfied on R. Since | f (t, x)| = |
<a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">|x 2 + cos2 t
|
| ≤ |
|x 2
|
| | +
|cos2 t
|
| ≤ |
|x 2
|
| + 1, and M = max|</span></a> f (t, x)| = 1 + b2 in R. Therefore,
from Picard’s theorem (if f (t, x) is a continuous function in a rectangle R =
{(t, x) : <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">|t − t0|</span></a> ≤ a, <a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">|x − x0|</span></a> ≤ b, a &gt; 0, b &gt; 0} and satisfies Lipschitz condition
therein, then the initial value problem x  ̇ = f (t, x), x(t0) = x0 has a unique solution
in the rectangle R’ = {(t, x) : <a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">|t − t0|</span></a> ≤ h, <a href="#id17"><span class="problematic" id="id18">|x − x0|</span></a> ≤ b}, where h = min{a, b/M},
M = max| f (t, x)| for all (t, x) ∈ R, see the books Coddington and Levinson
[5], Arnold [6]). Now h = min{
a, b
M
} = min{
a, b
1+b2
}
. We now determine the</p>
<p>maximum/minimum value(s) of b/(1 + b2). Let g(b) = b
1+b2 . Then g’
(b) = 1−b2
(1+b2)2</p>
<p>and g’’(b) = 2b(b2−3)</p>
<p>(1+b2)3 . For max or min value(s) of g(b), g’</p>
<p>(b) = 0. This gives b = 1.
Since g’’(1) = −1/2 &lt; 0, g(b) is maximum at b = 1 and the maximum value is
given by g(1) = 1</p>
<p>2 . Now, if a ≥ 1/2, then h = b</p>
<p>1+b2 ≤ 1/2 and if a &lt; 1/2, then
h &lt; 1/2. Thus we must have h ≤ 1/2. Hence the maximum interval of existence of
the solution of the given system is 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2.
(ii) Here f (t, x) = x 2. Consider the rectangle R =
{(t, x) : <a href="#id19"><span class="problematic" id="id20">|t|</span></a> ≤ a, <a href="#id21"><span class="problematic" id="id22">|x − 1|</span></a> ≤ b, a &gt; 0, b &gt; 0} containing the point (0, 1). Clearly,
f (t, x) is continuous and ∂ f</p>
<p>∂x = 2x is bounded on R. Hence the Lipschitz condi-
tion is satisfied on R. Also in R, M = max| f (t, x)| = (1 + b)2. Therefore,</p>
<p>h = min{
a, b
M
}
= min{
a, b
(1+b)2
}
. It can be shown, as earlier, that g(b) = b
(1+b)2 is
maximum at b = 1 and the maximum value is g(1) = 1/4. Now if a ≥ 1/4, then
h = b
(1+b)2 ≤ 1/4 and if a &lt; 1/4, then h &lt; 1/4. Thus we must have h ≤ 1/4. Hence
the maximum interval of existence of solution of the given system is <a href="#id23"><span class="problematic" id="id24">|t|</span></a> ≤ 1/4, that</p>
<p>is, −1/4 ≤ t ≤ 1/4. Note that Picard’s theorem gives the local region of existence
of unique solution for a system.
Example 1.4 Using linear stability analysis determine the stability of the critical
points for the following systems:</p>
<p>(i) x  ̇ = sin x, (ii) x  ̇ = x 2
.</p>
<p>Solution (i) The given system has infinite numbers of critical points. The critical
points are x∗
n = nπ, n = 0, ±1, ±2,… . When n is even, f ‘
(x∗
n ) = cos(x∗
n ) =
cos(nπ ) = (−1)n = 1 &gt; 0. So, these critical points are unstable. When n is odd,
f ‘
(x∗
n ) = −1 &lt; 0, and so these critical points are stable.
(ii) The critical point of the system is at x∗ = 0. Now, f ‘</p>
<p>(x∗) = 0 and f ‘’(x∗) =
2 &gt; 0. Hence, x∗ is attracting when x &lt; 0 and repelling when x &gt; 0. Actually, the
critical point is semi-stable in nature.</p>
<p>1.7 Analysis of One-Dimensional Flows</p>
<p>As we know qualitative approach pioneered by Henri Poincaré is the combination of
analysis and geometry and is a powerful tool for analyzing solution behaviors of a
system qualitatively. Basically, the topological dynamical behaviors can be explored
using this mathematical tool. By drawing trajectories in phase line/plane/space, the
behaviors of phase points may be found easily. In qualitative analysis we mainly look
for the following solution behaviors:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>Local stabilities of fixed points for a system.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(ii) Analyzing the existence of periodic/quasiperiodic, torus solutions, limit cycles,
relaxation oscillation, hysteresis, the notions of local and global conjugations,
etc.</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple" start="3">
<li><p>Local and asymptotic solutions behaviors of a system.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(iv) Topological features of flows such as bifurcations, catastrophe, topological
equivalence, transitiveness, denseness, etc.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="22">
<li><p>How far can the evolution of a system be predicted in the long-term?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We shall now analyze a simple one-dimensional system as follows.</p>
<p>Consider a one-dimensional system represented as x ̇(t) = sin x with the initial
condition x(t = 0) = x(0) = x0. The characteristic features of the system are (i)
it is a one-dimensional system, (ii) nonlinear system, (iii) autonomous system, and
(iv) its closed-form solution (analytical solution) exists. This is a one-dimensional
flow and we analyze the system on the basis of flow. The analytical solution of the
system is obtained easily</p>
<p>dx
dt = sin x ⇒ dt = cosec(x)dx.</p>
<p>Integrating, we get</p>
<p>t = ∫ cosec(x)dx
= − log|cosec(x) + cot(x)| + c,</p>
<p>where c is an integrating constant. Using the initial condition x(0) = x0, we get the
integrating constant c as</p>
<p>c = log|cosec(x0) + cot(x0)|.</p>
<p>Thus, the solution of the system is given as</p>
<p>t = log
|
|
|
|
cosec(x0) + cot(x0)
cosec(x) + cot(x)
|
|
|
|
.</p>
<p>From this closed-form solution, the behaviors of solutions for any initial conditions
are difficult to analyze. Moreover, the asymptotic values of the system are also
difficult to obtain. The qualitative approach can give better dynamical behavior about
this simple system.</p>
<p>We consider t as time, x as the position of an imaginary particle moving along
the flow in real line and x  ̇ as the velocity of that particle. The differential equation
x  ̇ = sin x represents a vector field on the line. It gives the velocity vector x  ̇ at each
position x. The arrows point to the right when x  ̇ &gt; 0 and to the left when x  ̇ &lt; 0. We
shall draw the graph of sin x versus x in x x ̇-plane which gives the flow in the x-axis
(see Fig. 1.3).</p>
<p>We may imagine that fluid is flowing steadily along the x-axis with a velocity x  ̇
which varies from place to place, according to equation x  ̇ = sin x. At points x  ̇ = 0,
there is no flow and such points are called equilibrium points (fixed points). According
to the definition of fixed point, the equilibrium points of this system are obtained as
sin x = 0 ⇒ x = nπ(n = 0, ±1, ±2, …). This simple looking autonomous system
has infinite numbers of equilibrium points in R. We can see that there are two kinds
of equilibrium points. The equilibrium points where the flow is toward the point is
called sink or point attractor (neighboring trajectories approach asymptotically to
the point as t → ∞). On the other hand, when the flow is away from the point,
the point is called source or repeller (neighboring trajectories move away from the
point as t → ∞). From the above figure the solid circles represent the sinks that are
stable equilibrium points and the open circles are the sources, which are unstable
equilibrium points. The names are given because the sinks and sources are common
in fluid flow problems. From the geometric approach one can get local stability
behavior of the equilibrium points of the system easily and is valid for all time. We
shall now re-look the analytical solution of the system. The analytical solution can
be expressed as</p>
<p>t = log|tan(x/2)| + c ⇒ x(t) = 2 tan−1 (Aet ),</p>
<p>where A is an integrating constant.</p>
<p>Let the initial condition be x0 = x(0) = π/4. Then from the above solution we
obtain</p>
<p>A = tan(π/8) = −1 + √
2 = 1/
(
1 + √
2
)
.</p>
<p>So the solution is expressed as</p>
<p>x(t) = 2 tan−1
( et
1 + √2
)
.</p>
<p>We see that the solution x(t) → π and t → ∞.</p>
<p>Without using analytical solution for this particular initial condition, the same
result can be found by drawing the graph of x versus t. So, the solution’s behavior
at any initial condition can be obtained easily by geometric approach. This simple
one-dimensional system also has an interesting application. For a slow motion of a
spring immersed in a highly viscous fluid such as grease or viscoelastic fluid (the
combined effects of fluid viscosity and elasticity for example, synovial fluid in the
joints of human bones), the viscous damping force is very strong compared to the
inertia resulting in slow (creeping) motion. So one can neglect acceleration term (i.e.,
inertia) and the spring-mass system may be governed by the equation αx  ̇ = sin x,
where α &gt; 0 (string constant) is a real number and the dynamics can be obtained
using this approach for different values of α (see the book Strogatz [7] for more
physical examples).</p>
<p>We shall discuss a few worked-out examples presented below.</p>
<p>Example 1.5 With the help of flow concept discuss the local stability of the fixed
points of x  ̇ = f (x) = (x 2 − 1).</p>
<p>Solution The fixed points of the given autonomous system are given by setting
f (x) = 0. This gives x = ±1. So the fixed points of the system are 1 and −1. For
the local stability of the system about these fixed points we plot the graph of the
function f (x) and then sketch the vector field. The flow is to the right direction,
indicated by the symbol ‘ → ’, where the velocity x  ̇ &gt; 0, that is, where (x 2 −1) &gt; 0
and to the left direction, indicated by the symbol ‘ ← ’, where x  ̇ &lt; 0, that is,
(x 2 − 1) &lt; 0. We also use solid circles to represent stable fixed points and open
circles for unstable fixed points.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1.4 the arrows indicate the flow of the system. From the figure, we see that
the fixed point x = 1 is unstable, since it acts as a source point and the fixed point
x = −1 is stable, since it acts as a sink point.</p>
<p>Example 1.6 Discuss the stability character of the fixed points for the system x  ̇ =
x(1 − x) using the concept of flow.
Solution Here f (x) = x(1 − x). Then for the fixed points, we have
f (x) = 0 ⇒ x(1 − x) = 0 ⇒ x = 0, 1.</p>
<p>Thus, the fixed points are 0 and 1. To discuss the stability of these fixed points
we plot the system (x versus x ̇) and then sketch the vector field. The flow is to the
right direction, indicated by the symbol ‘ → ’, when the velocity x  ̇ &gt; 0, and to the
left direction, indicated by the symbol ‘ ← ’, when x  ̇ &lt; 0. We also use solid circle
to represent stable fixed point and open circle to represent unstable fixed point.</p>
<p>From Fig. 1.5 we see that the fixed point x = 1 is stable, whereas the fixed point
x = 0 is unstable.</p>
<p>Example 1.7 Find the fixed points and analyze the local stability of the following
systems (i) x  ̇ = x + x 3 (ii) x  ̇ = x − x 3(iii) x  ̇ = −x − x 3.</p>
<p>Solution (i) Here f (x) = x + x 3. Then for fixed points f (x) = 0 ⇒ x + x 3 = 0 ⇒
x = 0, as x ∈ R. So, 0 is the only fixed point of the system. We now see that when
x &gt; 0, x  ̇ &gt; 0 and when x &lt; 0, x  ̇ &lt; 0. Hence the fixed point x = 0 is unstable. The
graphical representation of the flow generated by the system is displayed in Fig. 1.6.</p>
<p>(ii) Here f (x) = x − x 3. Then f (x) = 0 ⇒ x − x 3 = 0 ⇒ x = 0, 1, −1.
Therefore, the fixed points of the system are 0, 1, −1. We now see that</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>when x &lt; −1, then x  ̇ &gt; 0</p></li>
<li><p>when −1 &lt; x &lt; 0, x  ̇ &lt; 0</p></li>
<li><p>when 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, x  ̇ &gt; 0</p></li>
<li><p>when x &gt; 1, then x  ̇ &lt; 0.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This shows that the fixed points 1 and − 1 are stable, whereas the fixed point 0 is
unstable (Fig. 1.7).</p>
<p>(iii) Here f (x) = −x − x 3. Then f (x) = 0 ⇒ −x − x 3 = 0 ⇒ x = 0, as
x ∈ R. So x = 0 is the only fixed point of the system. We now see that x  ̇ &gt; 0 when
x &lt; 0 and x  ̇ &lt; 0 when x &gt; 0. This shows that the fixed point x = 0 is stable. The
graphical representation of the flow generated by the system is displayed in Fig. 1.8.</p>
<p>Example 1.8 Determine the equilibrium points and sketch the phase diagram in the
neighborhood of the equilibrium points for the system represented as x  ̇ + xsgn(x) =
0.</p>
<p>Solution Given system is x  ̇ + xsgn(x) = 0, that is, x  ̇ = − xsgn(x), where the
function sgn(x) is defined as</p>
<p>sgn(x) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
1, x &gt; 0
0, x = 0
−1, x &lt; 0</p>
<p>For equilibrium points, we have</p>
<p>x  ̇ = 0 ⇒ xsgnx = 0 ⇒ x = 0.</p>
<p>This shows that the system has only one equilibrium point at x = 0. In flow
analysis we see that the velocity x  ̇ &lt; 0 for all x /= 0. The flow is to the right
direction, when x  ̇ &gt; 0, in the negative x-axis and to the left direction, when x  ̇ &lt; 0,
in the positive x-axis. This is shown in the phase diagram depicted in Fig. 1.9, which
shows that the fixed-point origin is semi-stable.</p>
<p>1.8 Conservative and Dissipative Dynamical Systems</p>
<p>The dichotomy of dynamical systems in conservative versus dissipative is very important. They have some fundamental properties. Particularly, conservative systems are
the integral part of Hamiltonian mechanics. We give here only the formal definitions
of conservative and dissipative systems. Consider an autonomous system represented
as</p>
<p>x ̇
∼ = f
∼
(x
∼
), x
∼ ∈ Rn . (1.15)</p>
<p>The conservative and dissipative systems are defined with respect to the divergence
of the corresponding vector field, which in turn refers to the conservation of volume
or area in their state space or phase plane, respectively, as follows:</p>
<p>A system is said to be conservative if the divergence of its vector field is zero. On
the other hand, it is said to be dissipative if its vector field has negative divergence.
The phase volume in a conservative system is constant under the flow while for a
dissipative system the phase volume occupied by the system is gradually decreased
as the time t increases and shrinks to zero as t → ∞. When divergence of vector
field is positive, the phase volume is gradually expanding. We shall discuss it in a
later chapter. We state a lemma below which gives the change of volume in a phase
space for an autonomous system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is useful to find the evolution of volume in the phase space of a
system x ̇∼ = f (x∼), x∼ ∈ Rn. The system generates a flow φ(t, x
∼). We give Liouville’s theorem which describes the time evolution of volume under the flow φ(t, x
∼). Before this we now give the following lemma.</p>
<p>Lemma 1.1 Consider an autonomous vector field .x∼ = f (x∼), x∼ ∈ Rn, f ≡ f
∼ and generates a flow φt (x∼). Let D0 be a domain in Rn and φt (D0) be its evolution under
the flow. If V(t) is the volume of Dt , then the time rate of change of volume is given
as dVdt

<p>Theorem 1.1 (Liouville’s theorem) Suppose ∇ · f = 0 for a vector field f . Then for
any region D0 ⊆ Rn, the volume V(t) generated by the flow φ(t, x∼) is V(t) = V (0),
V (0) being the volume of D0.</p>
<p>Proof Suppose the divergence of the vector field f is everywhere constant, that is,
∇ · f = c. For arbitrary time t0 the evolution equation for the volume is given as
V  ̇ = cV . This gives V (t) = V(0)ect . When the vector field is divergence free, that
is, c = 0, we get the result V  ̇ = 0 ⇒ V (t) = V (0) = constant. Thus, we can say
that the flow generated by a time independent system is volume preserving.</p>
<p>Examples of conservative and dissipative systems are presented below.</p>
<p>(a) Consider a linear and undamped pendulum represented as x  ̈ + x = 0. This is an
example of a conservative system. Setting x  ̇ = y, we can write it as a system
of equations x  ̇ = y, y  ̇ = −x.</p>
<p>The system may also be written in the compact form x ̇

and the area occupied in the xy-phase plane is constant.</p>

dissipative in nature and the area in the phase plane is decreasing as time goes on.
This is the simplest linear oscillator with linear damping. It describes a spring-mass
system with a damper in parallel. The spring force is proportional to the extension
x of the spring and the damping or frictional force is proportional to the velocity x ̇.
The two constants α and β are related to the stiffness of the spring and the degrees
of friction in the damper, respectively. According to the above lemma, the change in

<p>1.9 Some Definitions</p>
<p>In this section we give some important preliminary definitions relating to flow of a
system. The definitions given here are elaborately discussed in the later chapters for
higher-dimensional systems.</p>
<p>Invariant set A set D ⊂ Rn is said to be an invariant set under the flow φt if for any
point p ∈ D, φt (p) ∈ D for all t ∈ R. The set D is said to be positively invariant
if φt (p) ∈ D for t ≥ 0. Trajectories starting in an invariant set remain in the set
for all times. An interval is called trapping if it is mapped into itself and is said to
be invariant if it is mapped exactly onto itself. Moreover, if a bounded interval is
trapping, then all of its trajectories are trapped inside and must converge to a closed,
invariant and bounded limit set. Clearly, every orbit is invariant. On the other way,
the basin of attraction of the flow trajectories is the set of all initial states for which
its long-time behavior approaches to certain limit set. Due to the continuity of flow
and properties of fixed points, it can be easily verified that the basin of attraction is
an invariant set. Moreover, its definition is self-sufficient to prove that for any point
of the basin set and for any arbitrary open set containing that point, the subsequent
flow always remains sufficiently close to every point of the open set. So, that basin
set of an attracting fixed point be open. It can prove easily. There exists an open set U
around an attracting fixed point x0 such that for any x∈U, φt(x)→ x0 as t→∞. If x1
be in its basin, then φt(x1)→ x0 as t→∞. Since, φt is continuous so, the preimage
of U under it say V is also open and contains that x1. Now, as for any point in V
ends up in U after large time and attracts the point x0. So it is obvious that, any
x1 in the basin has an open neighborhood V around it which is entirely within the
basin. The limit sets are called attractors of a system. Attractors are classified into
different types. The regular attractors specify the equilibrium point or point attractor,
periodic orbits, limit cycles, torus, and quasiperiodic motions. There are another
class of fractal-like attractors, known as strange attractors in deterministic nonlinear
dissipative systems. They are erratic, aperiodic, and unpredictable, which are main
attributes of chaos. However, there exist nonchaotic strange attractors also.</p>
<p>Theorem 1.2 The ternary Cantor set is uncountable but invariant.</p>
<p>Proof The ternary Cantor set C can be constructed by using the two contrac-
tion transformations T1 : x → x</p>
<p>3 , T2 : x → x
3 + 2
3 . Moreover, if a point</p>
<p>a = 0 · a1a2a3 … = ∑∞
i=1
( ai
3i
) ∈ C has triadic expansion with only 0 or 2,
and so ai /= 1. Again, each point in [0,1] has binary representation of the form
b = 0 · b1b2b3…, where bi = 0 or 1. Let us define a map f : C → [0, 1] by
f (0 · a1a2a3 …) = 0 · b1b2b3 … where bi = 0 if ai = 0
bi = 1 if ai = 2
)
Then clearly f is a bijection. Thus, C has a one-to-one correspondence with the
uncountable set [0,1]. So, C is also uncountable.
If we start with the closed and bounded interval A0 = [0, 1], then under the above
transformations we have A1 = T1[0, 1] ∪ T2[0, 1] = [
0, 1
3
]
∪ [ 2
3 , 1
]
. Applying
these transformations once again to each of the above intervals will give A2 =
T1
[
0, 1
3
]
∪ T2
[
0, 1
3
]
∪ T1
[ 2
3 , 1
]
∪ T2
[ 2
3 , 1
]
= [
0, 1
9
]
∪ [ 2
3 , 7
9
]
∪ [ 2
9 , 1
3
]
∪ [ 8
9 , 1
]
.
Thus, A2 is obtained from A1 by the transformations T1 and T2, similarly A3 will
be obtained from A2 and so on. So, we can write the Cantor set as, C = ∩∞
∩ n=1 An = ∞
n=1 T (An−1) = ∩∞</p>
<p>n=1 (T1(An−1) ∪ T2(An−1)) = 1
3
∩∞
n=1
(
An−1 ∪ ( 2
3 + An−1
)).
Thus C ⊂ T C. Moreover, if a point say a = 0.a1a2 … ∈ C has the triadic expansion
with only 0 or 2 then the points obtained after applying the transformations T1 and T2
have also the triadic expansion with 0 or 2. As, T1(0.a2a3…) = T1
( a2
3 + a3
32 + ···)
= 1
3
( a2
3 + a3
32 + ···) = a2
32 + a3
33 + ··· = 0
3 + a2
32 + a3
33 + ··· = 0.0a2a3 … and</p>
<p>T2(0 · a2a3 …) = T2
( a2
3 + a3
32 + ···)
= 2
3 + 1
3
( a2
3 + a3
32 + ···)
= 2
3 + a2
32 + a3
33 +··· =
0.2a2a3 ….This shows that a = 0.a1a2 … is the image of T1 if a1 = 0 and is the
image of T2 if a1 = 2. Hence, TC ⊂ C. So, we can write TC = C. Hence the Cantor
set is invariant under the contraction transformations T which is the combination of
T1 and T2.
Limit points: ω- and α-limit points
A continuous map f : X → X is said to be a topological system with discrete time or
simply a topological dynamical system where f is a homeomorphism that is a bijective
continuous map with continuous inverse. Any flow or semi-flow is a topological
dynamical system with continuous time. We now define two limiting topological
concepts which are relevant to the orbits of dynamical systems asymptotically. The
asymptotic behavior of a trajectory may be related with limit points/sets or cycles
and are termed as ω- and α-limit points/sets or cycles. The ω-limit set of a point p
is contained by the points that are arbitrarily approximated by the images of f n(p)</p>
<p>while the α-limit set of p is contained by the points that are arbitrarily approximated
by the preimages of f −n(p). We now give the mathematical definitions.
A point p ∈ Rn is called an ω-(resp. a α-) limit point if there exists a sequence
{ti} with ti → ∞ (resp. ti → −∞) such that the flow φ(ti , x) → p as i → ∞. The
ω-limit set(cycle) is denoted by ∧(x
∼
) and is defined as</p>
<p>∧(x
∼
) =
{
x
∼ ∈ Rn|∃ {ti} with ti → ∞ and φ(ti , x
∼
) → p as i → ∞}
.
Specifically, in a discrete-time system the ω- limit set of a point p is defined
(overbar indicates the closure of a set) as
∧(p) = ∩
n∈N
{
f m(p) : m ≥ n
}
.
Similarly, the α-limit set (cycle) for the flow φ(ti , x), μ(x
∼
) is defined as</p>
<p>μ(x
∼
) =
{
x
∼ ∈ Rn|∃ {ti} with ti → −∞ and φ(ti , x
∼
) → p as i → ∞}
.</p>
<p>The α- limit set in discrete-time system is defined by</p>
<p>μ(p) = ∩
n∈N
{
f −m(p) : m ≥ n
}
.</p>
<p>For example, consider a flow φ(t, x) on R2 generated by the system r  ̇ = cr (1 −
r ), θ ̇ = 1, c being a positive constant. For x</p>
<p>∼ /= 0, let p be any point of the closed</p>
<p>orbit C and take {ti}∞</p>
<p>i=1 to be the sequence of t &gt; 0. The trajectory through x crosses
the radial line through p. So, ti → ∞ as i → ∞ and φ(ti , x) → p as i → ∞. If x
∼
lies in the closed orbit C, then φ(ti , x) = p for each i. Hence every point of C is a
ω-limit point of x</p>
<p>∼ and so Ʌ(x) = C for every x /= 0. When <a href="#id25"><span class="problematic" id="id26">|x|</span></a> ≤ 1, the sequence</p>
<p>{ti}∞
i=1 with t &lt; 0 gives the α-limit set μ(x) =
(
{0} for|x| &lt; 1
closed orbit for|x| = 1.</p>
<p>When <a href="#id27"><span class="problematic" id="id28">|x|</span></a> &gt; 1, there is no sequence {ti}
∞
i=1, with ti → ∞ as i → ∞, such
that φ(ti , x) exists as i → ∞. So, μ(x) is empty when <a href="#id29"><span class="problematic" id="id30">|x|</span></a> &gt; 1. The closed orbit
C is called a limit cycle of the system, C : x 2 + y2 = 1, so the limit cycle is a
circle. In a similar way one can find the limiting sets for the flow represented by
r  ̇ = r (r − 1)(r − 2),θ ̇ = 1 as follows: (i) α(p) = ω(p) = {0, 0} for r = 0, (ii)
α(p) = {(0, 0)}, ω(p) = c1 : x 2 + y2 = 1 for r ∈ (0, 1), (iii )α(p) = ω(p) = c1
for r = 1, (iv) α(p) = c1, ω(p) = c2 for r ∈ (1, 2), (v) α(p) = ω(p) = c2 for
r = 2, (vi) α(p) = c2, ω(p) = φ for r &gt; 2. Since θ increases as t increases the
trajectories move in anticlockwise direction. So, there exists two limit cycle c1 and
c2. It reveals that there exist flows with multiple limit cycles.</p>
<p>The trajectory of a system through a point x</p>
<p>∼ is the set γ (x
∼
) = U
t∈R φ(t, x

)</p>
<p>and the corresponding positive semi-trajectory γ +(x

<p>γ −(x

φ(t, x

).</p>
<p>We now state two lemmas below. Interested readers can try for proofs (see
Glendinning [8]).
Theorem 1.3 Prove that the ω-limit set is invariant, nonempty, and compact if the
positive orbit is bounded.
Proof If Ʌ(x) is finite, then it is closed. Let Ʌ(x) = ω be infinite. Taking α ∈ ω’
(the
derived set of ω). So, for all open neighborhood Nδ (α) of α, Nδ (α) ∩ ω /= ∅. Let
pδ ∈ Nδ (α) ∩ ω. Since Nδ (α) is open, so for all δ1 &gt; 0, Nδ1 (pδ ) ⊂ Nδ (α) and
Nδ1 (pδ ) ∩ γ +(x) /= ∅. This implies, Nδ (α) ∩ γ +(x) /= ∅. Hence, α ∈ ω. That
is,Ʌ(x) = ω is closed.
Moreover if γ +(x) is bounded, then its set of limit point Ʌ(x) is also bounded.
So, Ʌ(x) is compact.
Let p ∈ ω. Then there exists a sequence {tk } → ∞ such that {φ(tk , x)} → p. By
using the continuity and flow properties of φ, we get
φ(t, p) = φ
(
t, lim
k→∞ φ(tk , x)
)
= lim
k→∞ φ(t, φ(tk , x)) = lim</p>
<p>k→∞ φ(t + tk , x).
This implies there exists a sequence, {t + tk } which converges to infinity such
that φ(t + tk , x) → φ(t, p). Therefore, φ(t, p) ∈ ω. Hence, Ʌ(x) = ω is invariant
under the flow φ.

<p>Non-wandering point A point p is called a nonwandering point if for any neighbor-
hood U of p and for any T &gt; 0, there exists some <a href="#id31"><span class="problematic" id="id32">|t|</span></a> &gt; T such that φ(t, U )∩U /= φ.</p>
<p>The nonwandering set, denoted by Ω, contains all such points p ∈ U and it is closed.
Nonwandering points give asymptotic behavior of the orbit. In the above definition,
if φ(t, U ) ∩ U = φ, then the point p is called a wandering point.
The examples of nonwandering points are fixed points and periodic orbits of a
system. For the undamped oscillator (
..
x +x = 0), all points are nonwandering in</p>
<p>x x  ̇ phase plane while for the damped oscillator (
..
x +αx  ̇ + x = 0), origin is the only
nonwandering point. We now give some specific definitions of invariant sets.
Absorbing set A positive invariant compact subset B ⊆ Rn is said to be an absorbing
set if there exists a bounded subset C of Rn with C ⊃ B such that tC &gt; 0 ⇒
φ(t,C) ⊂ B∀t ≥ tC (see Wiggins [9] for details).
Trapping zone An open set U in an invariant set D ⊂ Rn in an attracting set for
a flow generated by a system is called a trapping zone. Let a set A be closed and
invariant. The set A is said to be stable if and only if every neighborhood of A contains
a neighborhood U of A which is trapping.
Basin of attraction The domain (called as basin of attraction) of an attracting set D
is defined as U</p>
<p>t≤0 φ(t, U ) where U is any open set in D ⊂ Rn. It is also an invariant
set. The basin of attraction for the flow as in Fig. 1.3 for a particular fixed point
say π is (0,2π). The basin of attractions of other attracting fixed points can be found.
Attracting set A closed invariant set D ⊂ Rn for a flow φt is said to be an attracting
∩
set if there exists some neighborhood U in D such that ∀t ≥ 0, φ(t, U) ⊂ U and
t&gt;0 φ(t, U ) = D.
We now give an example of attracting set which is invariant and closed from</p>
<p>Ruelle [10] and discussed in Guckenheimer and Holmes [11] also. Consider the one-
dimensional system x  ̇ = −x 4 sin(π/x). It has countably infinite set of fixed points</p>
<p>at x∗ = 0, ±1</p>
<p>n , n = 1, 2, 3,…. All fixed points are in [-1,1]. The flow generated on</p>

<p>The fixed point x∗ = 0 is neither attracting nor repelling. The fixed points x∗ =

2n , n = 1, 2,… are repelling while the fixed points x∗ = ± 1</p>
<p>(2n−1), n = 1, 2,…
are attracting. Hence using the above definition of attracting set, the closed interval
[-1,1] is an attracting set of the given system.</p>
