Parkinson Disease
=================

ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that is increasing in 
prevalence especially as the 
population continues to age. This article provides an overview of the clinical presentation and evaluation for PD, genetic and 
environmental risk factors, and current treatments.

aumentando, especialmente con el envejecimiento poblacional. Este artículo ofrece una visión general de la presentación clínica y la evaluación de la 
EP, los factores de riesgo genéticos y ambientales, y los tratamientos actuales. <blue>`

 LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: New treatments for motor symptoms 
of PD (eg, 
motor fluctuations, extending “on time”), including istradefylline and opicapone, have been approved. A subcutaneous pump to provide 
dopaminergic agents to patients is now available. Additionally, skin biopsy staining for a-synuclein has become a viable option for 
patients with diagnostic uncertainty of synucleinopathy.

ESSENTIAL POINTS: PD is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative movement
disorder with many potential presentations. Both motor and nonmotor symptoms are present during the disease course, and symptomatic 
medication and advanced surgical techniques have the potential to improve quality of life. Patients living with PD may manifest 
improvement in symptoms and quality of life from behavioral, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions. There remains no clear 
intervention to modify the progression of PD.
