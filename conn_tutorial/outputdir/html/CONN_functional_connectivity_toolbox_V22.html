<h1>CONN functional connectivity toolbox: RRID:SCR_009550, Version 22<a class="headerlink" href="#conn-functional-connectivity-toolbox-rrid-scr-009550-version-22" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Abstract: CONN is a Matlab-based cross-platform software for the computation, display, and analysis of functional connectivity in fMRI
(fcMRI). Version 22 brings a number of updates and additions to previous releases. Some of the main new procedures and tools include
new interactive analyses exploring the entire brain-wide functional connectome, with a focus on descriptions of commonalities as well
as heterogeneity of functional connectivity patterns across subjects and experimental conditions (similar to AFNI instacorr but across
all subjects in a study; available in 2nd -level fc-MVPA summary tab), new preprocessing options for normalizing anatomical and
functional volumes in the presence of anatomical lesions (available in Setup.Preprocessing), new displays for ROI-to-ROI connectivity
and contingency table data (in ROI-to-ROI results explorer), as well as the ability to create automated text, distributed under a
public domain dedication license, describing in detail the specific preprocessing, denoising, 1st - and 2nd - level analyses steps
performed on each individual CONN project (available in Tools.WriteMethods).</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>CONN is a Matlab-based cross-platform software for the computation, display, and analysis of functional connectivity in fMRI (fcMRI).
Connectivity measures include seed-to-voxel connectivity maps, ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrices, graph properties of connectivity
networks, generalized psychophysiological interaction models (gPPI), intrinsic connectivity, local correlation, global correlation,
inter-hemispheric correlation, independent component analyses (ICA), functional connectivity multivariate pattern analyses (fc-MVPA),
and dynamic component analyses (dyn-ICA).</p>
<p>CONN is available for resting state data (rsfMRI) as well as task-related designs. It covers the entire pipeline from raw fMRI data to
hypothesis testing, including spatial coregistration, ART-based scrubbing, aCompCor strategy for control of physiological and movement
confounds, first-level connectivity estimation, and second-level random-effect analyses and hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>Note: a standalone version of CONN for linux64 systems (precompiled including both SPM and CONN) that does not require Matlab
installed or a Matlab license can be downloaded from www.nitrc.projects/conn.</p>
<p>OS-specific notes: On Mac OS/X use “ctrl-click” instead of “right-click” to bring contextual menus in the CONN gui; If the default GUI
display fonts are too small click on Tools-&gt;GUI settings to change the GUI font size (your choice of font sizes will be kept across
CONN sessions and across toolbox updates); When using VNC to connect remotely to Linux machines type in Matlab’s command window opengl
software right after starting Matlab if you experience VNC crashes when displaying 3d renderings or when printing;</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>In order to perform connectivity analyses using this toolbox you will need:</p>
<p>Functional data. Either resting-state or task designs can be analyzed.</p>
<p>Structural data. At least one anatomical volume for each subject (this is used mostly for plotting purposes but also to derive the
gray/white/CSF masks used in the aCompCor confound removal method)</p>
<p>ROI definitions. A series of files defining seeds of interest. ROIs can be defined from mask images, text files defining a list of MNI
positions, or multiple-label images. The toolbox also provides a series of default pre-defined regions of interest that that will be
loaded automatically. These include a series of seed areas useful for investigating resting state connectivity –regions characterizing
DMN, dorsal attention network, executive control network, etc.-, as well as a complete brain parcellation including 91 cortical areas
and 15 subcortical areas from the FSL Harvard-Oxford Atlas as well as 26 cerebellar areas from the AAL atlas. See the
conn/utils/otherrois/ folder for additional/optional ROI files, including Brodmann areas, large-voxel parcellations, etc.</p>
<p>tip: To try out the toolbox in the absence of any data, select Help. Sample Data in the CONN gui in order to automatically download
and process the NYU test-retest dataset</p>
<p>The toolbox operation is divided in four sequential steps:</p>
<p>Setup: Defines basic experiment information, data locations, regions of interest (seeds), temporal covariates, and second-level
models. Optionally, perform functional and anatomical preprocessing steps if necessary, including realignment, slice-timing
correction, coregistration/normalization, segmentation, outlier identification, and smoothing.</p>
<p>Denoising: Define, explore, and remove possible confounds in the BOLD signal, including motion, physiological and other noise sources.</p>
<p>Analyses: Perform first-level analyses. Define the seeds of interest and explore the functional connectivity of different sources
separately for each subject. Define ICA, voxel-to-voxel analyses, dynamic analyses, etc.</p>
<p>Results: Perform second-level analyses. Define group analyses and perform population-level inferences from the resulting connectivity
measures of each first-level analysis.</p>
<p>Each of these steps can be defined interactively using the toolbox GUI or programmatically using scripts and conn_batch functionality.
In addition, and both when using the GUI or batch processes, all of the analyses can be performed locally on a single computer, or
they can be distributed among multiple computers in a cluster environment. Currently CONN supports Sun Grid Engine (SGE), Open Grid
Scheduler (OGS/GE) and other Grid Engine implementations, PBS/Torque, LSF, and Slurm batch queuing systems. The following sections
describe the experiment definition and analysis steps when using the GUI on a local computer in more detail. See
Help.Documentation.Info:batch processing for additional information on batch scripts, or see Help.Documentation.Info:grid computing as
well as Tools.Grid settings for additional information on cluster environments.</p>
<p>General help resources In the CONN GUI select Help.Search to easily search through a database of user questions/answers, select
Help.Updates to check and update CONN to the latest available release, select Help.Documentation for general documentation, and
Help.Web for additional resources.</p>
<p>Step one: setup (defines experiment information, file sources for</p>
<p>functional data, structural data, regions of interest, and other covariates)</p>
<p>Click on Project.Load to load an existing CONN</p>
<p>Or click on the Project.New (blank) button to start a new project</p>
<p>Note: If the data has initially been defined/analyzed in SPM you can skip several of the steps explained below to import your data by
using instead the automatic Import functionality. If you want to use this functionality select the option Project.New (import) instead
of Project.New (blank) when creating your project, and then choose the source and format of your input data (DICOM files, a set of SPM
first-level analyses, a BIDS dataset, or a fMRIPrep preprocessed dataset) and CONN will automatically import several relevant data
files automatically from those sources (and you can then proceed to manually import any additional files or data if necessary).</p>
<p>Basic experimental info Setup</p>
<p>Click on the Basic button on the left side, enter experiment information (Number of subjects, TR, number of sessions per subject, and
acquisition type). If the same number of sessions was acquired for every subject enter a single number in Number of sessions,
otherwise enter the subject-specific values (one value per subject). If your data was acquired continuously select ‘continuous’ in
Acquisition type, and if you used sparse sampling select ‘sparse’ (this will skip hrf-convolution when computing task effects). If
your data was acquired using different TR values, enter NaN in the TR field and CONN will read this information from the
RepetitionTime field of a sidecar .json file associated with each functional run NIFTI .nii file.</p>
<p>Structural files Setup</p>
<p>Click on the Structural button on the left side to load the structural images. Click sequentially on each subject and select the
associated anatomical image (one anatomical volume per subject). If you have multiple anatomical volumes per subject (e.g. one per
session/scan), select ‘Multiple anatomical scans per subject’ and then enter the corresponding session-specific anatomical volumes.
Anatomical volumes should typically be coregistered to the functional and ROI volumes for each subject (e.g. if using MNI-space
normalized functional volumes you should enter here the normalized anatomical volume). Alternatively you may enter the raw
(subject-space) anatomical volumes and transform them to your desired target space (e.g. MNI) using ‘structural tools: individual
preprocessing step’ or ‘Preprocessing’ (see Notes on Structural, Functional, and ROI files coregistration section below).</p>
<p>GUI tip 1: The “Find” in the “Select functional data files” window can be used to search for all files within the target folder
recursively. Change the “Filter” window to narrow the search.</p>
<p>GUI tip 2: If multiple subjects are selected in the “Subjects” list, and the number of files selected in the “Select functional data
files” window matches the number of subjects, each subject is assigned one single file from the list</p>
<p>If your structural volumes have been preprocessed using Freesurfer (<a class="reference external" href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</a>), you may enter here the T1 or
brainmask volumes in the subject-specific mri folder generated by Freesurfer. The toolbox will identify the associated surf folder
containing the estimated cortical surfaces and it will display at this point a 3d-rendering of the pial surface (and this will allow
you to obtain connectivity measures on the cortical surface; see Options Setup section below).</p>
<p>Functional files Setup</p>
<p>Click on Functional button on the left side, from the right side panel, select the functional images (4D NIFTI .nii files, or multiple
3D NIFTI .nii or ANALYZE .img files). This will take a second to load, check the middle panel (Functional data setup) to make sure the
correct volumes are loaded. The brain display in the “Functional data setup” window shows the first (left) and last (right) scan for
the selected subject/session (as in the figure above). The functional images are expected to be already pre-processed (realigned and
smoothed), as well as coregistered with the structural and ROI volumes. If they are not, you may select ‘functional tools: individual
preprocessing step’ or ‘Preprocessing’ to perform the appropriate preprocessing steps (see Notes on Structural, Functional, and ROI
files coregistration section below). Clicking on ‘functional tools: check registration’ displays the coregistration between the
functional and structural volumes for the selected subjects/sessions.</p>
<p>Preprocessing functional &amp; structural data</p>
<p>After defining your raw Functional and Structural data, using Setup.Preprocessing you may run any combination of preprocessing steps
(e.g. realignment, normalization, segmentation, outlier detection, etc.). Select individual spatial preprocessing steps or select one
of the provided default pipelines (defaultMNI for analyses in MNI-space, and defaultSS for analyses in subject-space or surface-based
analyses), add, remove, or resort individual steps if you wish to better tailor it to your data or planned analyses, and then click
‘Ok’ to run the entire sequence of spatial preprocessing steps on all of the defined subjects or on a subset of subjects. For
reference, CONN’s defaultMNI pipeline consists of the following steps: functional realignment and unwarping, slice-timing correction,
outlier detection, structural segmentation&amp;normalization, functional normalization, and smoothing. If your functional and structural
data has been already preprocessed using SPM or other software you may simply skip all or any unnecessary preprocessing steps here.
See www.conntoolbox.org/fmri-methods/preprocessing-pipeline and “help conn_batch” for details about all of the different</p>
<p>preprocessing steps available in CONN</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Typically, after selecting all structural, functional, and ROI files in the Setup step, and further applying any additional spatial
preprocessing if necessary, all of the structural, functional, and ROI files should be coregistered to each other (in the same space;
e.g. MNI-space)1 . This will happen, for example, when using CONN’s initial spatial preprocessing pipeline (defaultMNI), which will
result in both functional and structural files being in MNI-space (note that all of the ROIs provided in the toolbox conn/rois folder
are also defined in MNI-space).</p>
<p>In some cases you might want to relax this condition and use structural/functional/ROI files that might not be all in the same space
(e.g. using subject-specific ROI files, surface-based analyses, etc.). The toolbox uses separate ROI-level and voxel-level pipelines,
and the tables below show typical configurations of Structural/Functional/ROI files that one would select depending on the desired
analysis option within each of these pipelines. For example, if you want to perform volume-based analyses on MNI-space for voxel-level
analyses, but use subject-specific ROIs for ROI-level analyses, you will only need to have the functional files coregistered to the
structural files (both normalized in MNI-space), and separately the functional files (ROI extraction option) coregistered to the ROI
files (typically in subject-space).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>although not necessarily having the same dimensions or resolution (i.e. coregistered, but not necessarily resliced to the same
reference space)</p>
<p>If your structural or functional files are not in the desired space or they have not been yet spatially preprocessed, you may (during
the Setup step) apply any combination of structural segmentation, structural segmentation&amp;normalization, functional removal of intial
scans, functional realignment, functional realignment&amp;unwarp, functional realignment&amp;unwarp&amp;B0correction, functional slice timing
correction, functional coregistration to structural volumes, functional normalization, functional outlier detection (ARTbased
scrubbing), and functional smoothing steps to your structural/functional files using the tools: individual preprocessing step menu on
each of the Structural and Functional tabs, or from Setup.Preprocessing:</p>

<p>Methods</p>
<p>Results included in this manuscript come from analyses performed using CONN [1] (RRID:SCR_009550) release</p>
<p>19.a [2] and SPM [3] (RRID:SCR_007037) release 12.7771.</p>
<p>Preprocessing: Functional and anatomical data were preprocessed using a flexible preprocessing pipeline[4]  including realignment with
correction of susceptibility distortion interactions, slice timing correction, outlier detection, direct segmentation and MNI-space
normalization, and smoothing. Functional data were realigned using SPM realign &amp; unwarp procedure[5] , where all scans were
coregistered to a reference image (first scan of the first session) using a least squares approach and a 6 parameter (rigid body)
transformation[6] , and resampled using b-spline interpolation to correct for motion and magnetic susceptibility interactions.
Temporal misalignment between different slices of the functional data (acquired in interleaved Siemens order) was corrected following
SPM slice-timing correction (STC) procedure[7,8] , using sinc temporal interpolation to resample each slice BOLD timeseries to a
common mid-acquisition time. Potential outlier scans were identified using ART [9] as acquisitions with framewise displacement above
0.5 mm or global BOLD signal changes above 3 standard deviations[10,11] , and a reference BOLD image was computed for each subject by
averaging all scans excluding outliers. Functional and anatomical data were normalized into standard MNI space, segmented into grey
matter, white matter, and CSF tissue classes, and resampled to 2 mm isotropic voxels following a direct normalization procedure
[11,12] using SPM unified segmentation and normalization algorithm [13,14] with the default IXI-549 tissue probability map template.
Last, functional data were smoothed using spatial convolution with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full width half maximum (FWHM).</p>

<p>ROI files Setup</p>
<p>Click on the ROIs button on the left side to load ROI mask files (.img or .nii volumes), MNI coordinate files (.tal text files), or
atlas files (.nii files with multiple labels, or 4d files with multiple masks). ROI files can be assigned separately to each subject
(for subject-specific ROIs) or commonly across all subjects (normalizedspace ROIs). From each ROI, CONN may extract an average BOLD
signal timeseries within the ROI voxels (extract average timeseries option), multiple timeseries from a Principal Component
decomposition of the BOLD signal within ROI voxels (extract PCA decomposition option), or a weighted sum of the BOLD signal within ROI
voxels (weighting each voxel timeseries by a different factor; extract weighted sum timeseries option). Also you may indicate which
dataset, among potentially multiple alternative functional datasets, each ROI BOLD signal is to be computed from (‘from functional
dataset #’ field; see Other files Setup section below).</p>
<p>Running the structural or functional segmentation Preprocessing step will automatically fill-in the first three ROIs in this tab
(Gray/White/CSF) with the corresponding subject-specific masks. By default all new projects in CONN are set up to extract a Principal
Component decomposition from both the White and CSF regions which can later be used during the Denoising step to implement aCompCor
(removal of White/CSF noise components).</p>
<p>When starting a new project all files in the rois toolbox folder (./conn/rois) will be imported as initial regions of interest. This
folder includes: 1) atlas.nii/.txt/.info, an atlas of cortical and subcortical areas from the FSL Harvard-Oxford Atlas, as well as
cerebellar areas from the AAL atlas; and 2) networks.nii/.txt/.info, an atlas of a few commonly used networks and areas (e.g. Default
Mode MPFC/PCC/RLP/LLP areas)</p>
<p>Default ROIs. atlas.nii (left, 132 ROIs) and networks.nii (right, 31 ROIs across 8 networks).</p>
<p>To import new ROIs, click below the last ROI listed and enter the appropriate information. To remove an existing ROI from this list
right-click on an ROI and select “remove”. When importing subject-specific ROIs click sequentially on each subject and select the
corresponding ROI file. When importing subject-independent ROI files, select all subjects simultaneously and then select the
corresponding ROI file or simply uncheck the Subject-specific ROI option before selecting a single ROI file.</p>
<p>Select “Subject-specific ROI” and/or “Session-specific ROI” to specify whether you would like to enter different ROI files for each
subject and/or each session.</p>
<p>Load the grey matter, white matter and CSF mask for each subject if they already exist (if left blank, the toolbox will generate these
masks by performing segmentation on the structural image for each subject)</p>
<p>ROI files should be coregistered to the provided structural and functional volumes of this subject (they could be defined in
normalized space, or they could be defined in subject-space). Click on ROI tools: check registration to display the coregistration
between the selected ROI(s) and the structural or functional volumes (see Notes on Structural, Functional, and ROI files
coregistration section below for additional options).</p>
<p>The default dimensions (number of PCA components to be extracted) for each ROI can be changed when selecting the extract PCA
decomposition option. In the following steps (denoising, analyses), you can later select the number of components among the extracted
ones you wish to use in the connectivity analyses. If one dimensions is chosen for a ROI the time-series of interest is defined by the
average BOLD activation within the ROI voxels. If more than one dimension is chosen for a ROI the time-series of interest are defined
as the principal eigenvariates of the time-series within the ROI voxels (note: PCA decomposition is performed after removal of
task-effects and first-level covariates when selecting the regress-out covariates option).</p>
<p>Select “mask with grey matter” on selected ROIs to further restrict these ROIs’ voxels to those voxels within the estimated grey
matter mask for each subject.</p>
<p>Select “multiple ROIs” if the ROI file contains multiple labels (e.g. atlas file TD.img provided in roi folder), or multiple
disconnected sets (e.g. functionally-defined ROI composed of multiple clusters, and you wish to use each cluster as a separate seed).</p>
<p>Other files Setup</p>
<p>Click on Other button on the left side, from the middle panel select an existing secondary dataset that you would like to import or
select ‘New dataset’ to define a new secondary dataset. Secondary datasets are where any additional subject- and session- specific
image files that may be useful or relevant to your study are defined. For example, if you wish to define an alternative set of
functional volumes that you would like to be used as sources when extracting ROI-level BOLD signal estimates for some particular ROI,
that dataset can be defined in this tab, assigned a label, and then in the Setup.ROIs tab you would only have to specify which
particular ROI(s) you would like to extract data from this particular dataset.</p>
<p>By default the toolbox will automatically define a dataset named ‘unsmoothed volumes’ pointing to the unsmoothed functional volumes
(using the SPM-convention for unsmoothed volumes, same filenames without the initial ‘s’ in the file name) and this dataset will be
the one used unless specified otherwise when extracting ROI-level BOLD signal timeseries for all ROIs, in order to avoid “spillage”
from nearby regions (see ROI files Setup section above). You may also create a new secondary dataset named ‘VDM’ to define subject and
session-specific .vdm files for susceptibility distortion correction which can later be used by the realign&amp;unwarp preprocessing step.
A secondary dataset named ‘FMAP’ can also be created to enter fieldmap files for each subject and session, which can later be used by
the ‘creation of VDM files’ preprocessing step to automatically compute the above .vdm files. A secondary dataset named ‘TPM’ can also
be used to enter subject-specific TPM (Tissue Probability Maps) which can later be used by the functional/structural normalization
preprocessing steps. Other secondary datasets may be arbitrarily created to store different versions of the functional data. For
example, the default preprocessing pipeline in CONN will create a secondary dataset named ‘original data’ pointing to the original
functional data (before running any preprocessing steps), and a dataset named ‘MNI-space data’ pointing to the data in MNI-space
(before smoothing). If at some point you need to revert your functional data to a previous state (e.g. original data) simply select
the option ‘move datasets’ and transfer the ‘original data’ dataset to the main functional dataset.</p>
<p>Rest or task conditions Setup</p>
<p>Click on the Conditions button on the left side to define your experimental conditions. CONN will typically compute separate
connectivity measures for each individual condition that you define in this tab. Here you specify how each individual condition is
defined (is it associated with BOLD data from one or multiple runs? Does it cover the entire run or only some blocks or events during
the run? etc.)</p>
<p>Add any new condition to the ‘conditions’ list by clicking on the ‘+’ button there. Then enter the name of your condition in the
‘Condition’ field, and then select a combination of subjects and sessions in the ‘Subjects’ and ‘Sessions’ lists and specify how this
condition is defined for these subjects/sessions:</p>
<p>Select ‘condition spans entire selected session(s)’ if the condition spans the entire duration of these session(s), e.g. during a
resting state run</p>
<p>Select ‘condition is not present in selected session(s)’ if the condition is not present at any time during these session(s), e.g. in
a pre- post- design, the ‘pre’ condition is not present in the second functional session, and the ‘post’ condition is not present in
the first functional session</p>
<p>Select ‘task designs: condition present at blocks/events during these session(s)’ for task designs. In this case you will need to then
specify the onsets and durations of the blocks or events associated with this condition during these session(s). See the table below
for a few examples of condition onset/duration specification. For complex designs, condition information can also be imported using
the ‘functional tools. Import condition info from text file(s)’ menu from BIDS _events.tsv files, SPM .mat files, or custom .csv or
.txt files (see help conn_importcondition for additional details)</p>
<p>Select ‘hierarchical designs: condition defined as a function of other conditions’ to define secondor higher- order conditions in a
multi-level design. In this case you will need to specify how this (output) condition is defined as a function of other (input)
conditions. Available options are: average across input conditions; standard deviation across input conditions; minimum across input
conditions; maximum across input conditions; regressor in linear model fitting input conditions; and custom function across input
conditions. These options are particularly useful in the context of nonlinear relationships between the input and output conditions.
For linear relationships it is simpler to define the specific between-conditions contrast later in the second-level results tab,
without the need to manually define those contrasts at this point.</p>
<p>Additional options: Right-click on the conditions list to delete or replicate a condition; select condition tools to enter all
condition information simultaneously from a text file, or to copy or move a condition to the first-</p>
<p>level covariates list (e.g. when you are not interested in obtaining task-specific measures of functional connectivity, but want
instead to use Fair et al. method for estimating resting-state connectivity from blockor event-related designs). Optionally, you may
also define a temporal modulation factor (in condition-specific temporal modulation; this defaults to a timeseries defined by
hrf-convolvution of the condition blocks/events) in order to perform gPPI analyses for task-related designs, or analyze potential
temporal-modulation in fcMRI measures. You may also enter for each condition a condition-specific band-pass filter (in
condition-specific filter) as a way to explore potential frequency- modulation of fcMRI measures2 .</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>If you want to explore frequency-dependent variations in fcMRI measures, but do not wish to specify a series of frequency filters
manually, you may select filter-bank in the Temporal filter field, and enter there the desired number of frequency filters. This will
partition the frequency band defined in the Denoising step into n equally-sized frequency regions, and it will automatically create
one condition associated with each of these frequency bands. This allows you to use between-condition effects/contrasts as a way to
analyzing potential frequency-dependent differences in any of your fcMRI measures.</p>
<p>First-level (within-subjects) covariates Setup</p>
<p>Click on the Covariates:First-level button to define first level covariates such as realignment parameters to be used in the
first-level BOLD model. For each covariate select a .txt or .mat file (for each subject and session) containing the covariate time
series (e.g. select the realignment parameters file rp_*.txt to include the movement parameters as covariates).</p>
<p>When importing .txt files they should contain as many rows of number as scans for any given subject/session, and an arbitrary number
of columns (columns are separated by spaces). When importing .mat files they should contain a single variable (arbitrarily named)
consisting of a matrix with as many rows as scans for any given subject/session and arbitrary number of columns.</p>
<p>If you want to obtain aggregated subject-level measures of some of your first-level covariates (e.g. to compute the maximum amount of
movement for each subject, or the number of outlier scans for each subject) you may do so by selecting each first-level measure in the
covariates list and clicking on covariate tools: compute summary measures.</p>
<p>Running some of the functional Preprocessing steps will automatically create or fill-in several first-level covariates in this tab. In
particular, running the outlier scan identification ART-based scrubbing step will automatically create a first-level covariate named
‘scrubbing’ containing the offending scans for each subject/session (this variable can later be used during the Denoising step to
perform scrubbing), and running any of the functional realignment steps will automatically create a first-level covariate named
‘realignment’ containing the 6 rigid-body parameters characterizing the estimated subject motion for each subject/session (this
variable can also be later used during the Denoising step to perform regression of residual movementrelated effects). Also during ART
preprocessing step a covariate named ‘QC_timeseries’ is created containing two timeseries (BOLD global signal changes, in z-score
units, and framewise displacement, in mm units) that can be used for computing other quality control measures (e.g. using the
‘covariate tools. Compute new/derived second-level covariates’ menu) and/or for later changing the choice of outlier thresholds (using
the ‘covariate tools. Compute new/derived first-level covariates’ menu and recomputing the ‘scrubbing’ first-level covariate).</p>
<p>Second-level (between-subjects) covariates Setup</p>
<p>Click on the Covariates:Second-level button to define groups and subject-level regressors (e.g. behavioral measures). Click on the
empty space below the last variable in the Covariates list to add a new variable. For each variable enter the corresponding subject
values in the values field (one number per subject). Use 1/0 to define subject groups, or continuous values for between-subject
regression models. Missing values may be indicated using the special symbol NaN (second-level analyses that contain a variable with
missing values will automatically disregard the corresponding subjects’ data). Some examples of second-level covariates definitions
are below:</p>
<p>Second-level covariates example</p>
<p>Tip: In addition to simple lists of numbers like the examples above, the values field will also accept any valid Matlab syntax (e.g.
[ones(1,5) zeros(1,5)] or (1:10)&lt;=5 would produce the same values as the Patients example above). You may also refer to variables in
Matlab workspace by name, or refer to other already-defined secondlevel covariates by name (e.g. in the example above the covariate
Controls could also be defined simply entering in the values field AllSubjects –Patients).</p>
<p>By default the variable ‘AllSubjects’ is always created when starting a new project. In addition, running some of the Preprocessing or
Denoising steps will automatically create or fill-in several second-level covariates in</p>
<p>this tab. In particular, running the outlier scan identification ART-based scrubbing step will automatically create second-level
covariates named ‘QC_MeanMotion’, ‘QC_MaxMotion’, ‘QC_MeanGSchange’, ‘QC_MaxGSchange’, ‘QC_ValidScans’, and ‘QC_InvalidScans’
containing the mean (across valid scans only) and maximum inter-scan movement (framewise displacement), the mean (across valid scans
only) and maximum global signal change, the number of valid &amp; invalid scans observed for each subject/session. Similarly, running the
Denoising step will automatically create second-level covariates named ‘QC_BOLDstd’, ‘QC_GCOR’, and ‘QC_dof’, containing the BOLD
signal standard deviation (averaged across all voxels), global correlation index (average correlation coefficient between every pair
of voxels across the entire brain), and effective degrees of freedom after denoising, for each subject/condition. Any of these
variables can later be used during the Second-level analyses step for additional control over potential between-subject differences in
motion/outliers, or to help identify and remove potential outlier subjects.</p>
<p>Second-level covariates can be defined at any time in the analyses (changes to any of other “Setup” options requires rerunning all the
analyses steps, while changes to the second-level covariates do not). In addition, using the covariate tools menu, you can also import
covariates from a file (.txt, .csv, .tsv, or .mat files), discretize an existing covariate into new dichotomous covariates (e.g. from
a ‘group’ covariate with three levels, it will create new ‘group1’, ‘group2’, and ‘group3’ covariates), define new covariates
characterizing the interaction between other existing covariates (from a ‘age’ and ‘gender’ covariate it will create a new
‘age*gender’ interaction covariate), or orthogonalize a covariate against one or several of your other covariates (e.g. you may
‘center’ a between-subjects variable by orthogonalizing it against the constant –all subjects- term).</p>
<p>GUI tip: Use Tools-&gt;Calculator on the main CONN gui to visualize and analyze your current 2nd -level covariates (e.g. look at
potential between-group differences in subject movement, levels of association between your different subject-level measures, etc.).
The way to define 2nd -level analyses in the calculator is the same as that of the main CONN gui 2nd -level results view (see Step 4
below)</p>
<p>Options Setup</p>
<p>Click on the Options button for additional analysis options. Select the type of analyses that you wish to perform (ROI-to-ROI,
seed-to-voxel, and voxel-to-voxel). For voxel-based analyses define the desired analysis space (by default volume-based analyses using
isotropic 2mm voxels; you may indicate surfacebased analyses only if you have selected Freesurfer generated structural volumes for all
of your subjects) as well as the type of analysis mask to be used (by default a gray matter template mask).</p>
<p>Last select if you wish optional/additional output files to be created by the toolbox during the Setup and Denoising steps (these are
files that are not necessary for any of the CONN-based analyses, but could be useful for example if you plan to export some of the
toolbox intermediate results to other packages; e.g. confound-corrected BOLD timeseries, first-level seed-to-voxel r- or p-maps,
etc.).</p>
<p>When finished defining the experiment data in the Setup tab press Done in order to run the Setup processing pipeline.</p>
<p>This will import the functional data for each session. If the gray/white/CSF ROIs have not been defined before, this step will perform
segmentation of the structural data in order to define these masks (in this case, after this process is finished come back to Setup to
inspect the resulting ROIs for possible inconsistencies). Last, this step will also extract the voxel-level and ROI-level time-series
for each session (performing PCA on the within-ROI activations when appropriate). All of this information will be then propagated to
the Denoising tab (see below) which will become active/available allowing you to proceed with the next step in your
processing/analysis pipeline (denoising your data).</p>
<p>If, at some later point after having already run this Setup step, you need to go back and modify any of the information in the Setup
tab (with the exception of Setup.Covariates 2nd -level), after making those changes in the Setup tab remember to click on Done again
in order to propagate those changes to the Denoising tab again (you may select the option ‘do not overwrite (skip already processed
subjects/ROIs)’ if the modifications in the Setup tab consisted simply in adding new subjects and/or defining new ROIs, since in those
cases there is no need to repeat this step for the already processed subjects/ROIs). Note that the same will need to be done in the
Denoising tab in order to propagate those changes to the first-level analysis tab, etc.</p>
<p>The Save / Save as button will save the CONN project setup configurations in a .mat file, which can be loaded later (Load button).
Note that in addition to your manually saving your project, this .mat file will also be automatically saved each time the Done button
is pressed on any of the Setup, Denoising, First-level analyses, or Second-level results tabs.</p>
<p>Step two: denoising (define, explore, and remove possible confounds)</p>
<p>Click on the DENOISING tab. This step applies linear regression and band-pass filtering in order to remove unwanted motion,
physiological, and other artifactual effects from the BOLD signal before computing connectivity measures. By default the system will
start with three different sources of possible confounders: 1) BOLD signal from the white matter and CSF masks (5 dimensions each); 2)
any previously-defined withinsubject covariate (realignment and scrubbing parameters); and 3) the main condition effects (condition
blocks convolved with hrf). For each of the selected possible confounds you may change the number of dimensions (specifying how many
temporal components are being used), the derivatives order (specifying how many successive orders of temporal derivatives are included
in the model), and the order of polynomial expansion (specifying how many powers of each temporal component are to be used). For
example, the realignment confound (derived from the estimated subject motion parameters) is defined by default by 6 dimensions, and
the derivative order is set to 1 indicating that in addition the first-order temporal derivative of the motion parameters should also
be used as covariates. Similarly, the White Matter confound is defined by default by 5 dimensions and 0 derivative order (indicating
that 5 PCA temporal components are being used, with not additional temporal derivative terms).</p>
<p>By default and unless specified otherwise all new projects that use the default CONN preprocessing steps will be automatically set up
to use a combination of aCompCor (White and CSF ROIs, 5 components each), scrubbing (as many regressors as identified invalid scans),
motion regression (12 regressors: 6 motion parameters + 6 first-order temporal derivatives), and filtering in the Denoising step. In
addition for task designs the main effect of task (direct BOLD signal changes associated with the presence/absence of a task) are also
regressed out during this step unless specified otherwise. Additional/alternative denoising steps can be specified by
adding/substituting effects listed in the ‘confounds’ list. For example GSR is performed when introducing the GrayMatter ROI as an
additional regressor; ICA denoising is performed when entering in the confounds list the ROIs associated with all noise components
identified during ICA (see ICA analyses below, method (3) of ROI definition).</p>
<p>The “Preview results” window in the right panel shows the total variance explained (r-square) by each of the possible confounding
sources (for the selected subject/session data). The histogram plot at the center displays the voxel-to-voxel connectivity (r values)
before, and after confound removal. Typically confounds introduce a positive bias in connectivity measures so the histogram of
original connectivity values can appear “shifted” to the right. After confound removal the distribution of connectivity values appears
approximately centered. Clicking on the “Quality Control” button allows the creation of a number of quality control plots</p>
<p>to evaluate the quality of the denoising procedure and easily identify potential outlier subjects. All of the settings in the
Denoising tab can be modified and the associates changes in the observed histograms and spatial maps are estimated and displayed in
real time. Images are displayed in neurological format, hovering over the image will display voxel locations and reference areas3 .</p>
<p>Enter the band-pass filter information in the bottom-left box (two numbers, in Hz, defining the band-pass frequency window of
interest), as well as any additional desired denoising options (detrending removes linear/quadratic/cubic trends within each
functional session, and despiking applies a squashing function to reduce the influence of potential outlier scans).</p>
<p>By default CONN uses a regBP procedure for denoising (regression followed by band-pass filtering). Choose simultaneous if you prefer
to use a simult procedure (simultaneous regression and band-pass filtering), or select individual elements in the ‘confounds’ list and
mark the Filtered checkbox to select only a subset of regressors that should be regressed only within the frequency band of interest
(using regBP and setting all regressors to filtered is exactly equivalent to using simult)</p>
<p>When finished, press the Done button. This will filter the functional data and remove the effect of the defined confounds on all brain
voxels and regions of interest, and create condition-specific timeseries (voxel- and ROI- level) by concatenating the samples/scans
for each condition across all sessions.</p>
<p>As with other steps, if, at some later point after having already run this Denoising step, you need to go back and modify any of the
information in the Setup or Denoising tabs (e.g. adding more subjects, or modifying the denoising settings), remember to click Done
again in this tab in order to propagate those changes from the Denoising to the First-level analyses tab again (you may select the
option ‘do not overwrite (skip already processed subjects/ROIs)’ if the modifications in the Setup tab consisted simply in adding new
subjects and/or defining new ROIs, since in those cases there is no need to repeat this step for the already processed subjects/ROIs).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>You may click on Tools-&gt;Gui settings to change the default atlas used when displaying labels associated with each spatial location
(background reference atlas), as well as the default background image used in these displays (background anatomical image)</p>

<p>Methods</p>
<p>Results included in this manuscript come from analyses performed using CONN [1] (RRID:SCR_009550) release 19.a[2]  and SPM [3]
(RRID:SCR_007037) release 12.7771.</p>
<p>Denoising: In addition, functional data were denoised using a standard denoising pipeline [4] including the regression of potential
confounding effects characterized by white matter timeseries (5 CompCor noise components), CSF timeseries (5 CompCor noise
components), motion parameters and their first order derivatives (12 factors)[5] , outlier scans (below 30 factors)[6] , session
effects and their first order derivatives (2 factors), and linear trends (2 factors) within each functional run, followed by bandpass
frequency filtering of the BOLD timeseries [7] between 0.008 Hz and 0.09 Hz. CompCor [8,9] noise components within white matter and
CSF were estimated by computing the average BOLD signal as well as the largest principal components orthogonal to the BOLD average,
motion parameters, and outlier scans within each subject's eroded segmentation masks. From the number of noise terms included in this
denoising strategy, the effective degrees of freedom of the BOLD signal after denoising were estimated to range from 31 to 45.8
(average 43.6) across all subjects[10] .</p>

<p>SBC, RRC, gPPI, and temporal modulation analyses</p>
<p>When defining a new SBC analysis select from the ‘all ROIs’ list the sources (seeds) of interest and click the arrow to move these to
the ‘selected seeds/sources’ list. Similarly, in RRC analyses enter in the ‘selected seeds/sources’ list all of the ROIs that you
would like to be included in the ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix.</p>
<p>For each seed/source you may optionally also indicate the number of dimensions to be analyzed (e.g. when extracting multiple
components from a ROI), whether you want to include derivative terms, and the number of frequency bands if you wish to obtain for this
particular ROI/seed a simple decomposition of the connectivity estimates power spectrum.</p>
<p>The right panel (“Preview results”) displays the connectivity measures for each subject/condition/source. Analyses here are performed
in real-time (any changes in the “Define sources” definitions affect directly the results displayed in the “Preview” window). The
measures displayed in the “Preview results” brain image correspond to the connectivity measure selected (r if correlation is selected,
beta if regression is selected). The threshold value is also defined in the same units (in the figure above, voxels with correlation
coefficients</p>
<p>above 0.25 are shown/colored). For volume-based analyses images are displayed in neurological format (click on the image to see the
voxel locations and Brodmann areas). For surface-based analyses images are displayed on the fsaverage brain. After the analyses have
been run you may also click on the Plot subjects button to access additional display of the computed connectivity measures for each
individual subject.</p>
<p>In the context of multiple of a task- design or multiple conditions the default behavior is to use a weighted General Linear Model
(weighted GLM) for weighted regression/correlation measures of the conditionspecific association between the seed/source BOLD
timeseries and each voxel or target ROI BOLD timeseries. This model is appropriate both for resting state as well as task-related
designs. When using weighted GLM click on Weights to change the relative weighting of the scans within each condition (by default
condition-specific weights are defined from the hrf-convolved blocks/events for each condition). In addition to the standard bivariate
correlation measure for functional connectivity analyses, you may also select regression measures, as well as define whether you want
to compute bivariate measures –analyzing individual seed/sources separately-, or semipartial/multivariate –where all of the
sources/ROIs are entered jointly into the general linear model to estimate their unique contributions-.</p>
<p>An alternative approach for event-related designs is to select gPPI analyses instead. PPI analyses compute the interaction between the
seed/source BOLD timeseries and a chosen condition-specific interaction factor when predicting each voxel or target ROI BOLD
timeseries. In addition, generalized PPI will include the interaction factors from all conditions simultaneously in the estimation
model in order to better account for between-condition overlaps. Click on gPPI analysis of selected task factors to define which
conditions to be included simultaneously in the gPPI model. You may choose all task conditions, for example, to perform standard gPPI
analyses, or you may select no conditions (or click Cancel) to perform standard PPI (singlecondition) analyses. Click on source
timeseries and select first-level design matrix instead if you want to view the design matrix associated with this gPPI analysis. The
term highlighted in red in this display is the one that characterizes the interaction term for the selected subject and condition.</p>
<p>In the context of temporal modulation analyses click on temporal modulation analysis of selected task factors and select when prompted
the desired factor (e.g. select an ROI to perform standard physiophysiological interaction analyses, or select any user-defined
first-level covariate to estimate the association between changes in this covariate and functional connectivity strength) 4 . If you
enter a first-level covariate that contains multiple timeseries, the model will include equally the main and interaction terms for all
of the timeseries, but the last timeseries will be considered the effect-of-interest (the estimated interaction with this term will be
passed to the second-level results tab) and the others will be considered control covariates (their interaction are still included in
the model and estimated, but their magnitude is not stored/saved). Click on source timeseries and select first-level design matrix
instead if you want to view the design matrix associated with this temporal modulation analysis. The term highlighted in red is the
one that characterizes the interaction term for the selected subject and condition.</p>
<p>For all of these analyses you may use the Analysis options menu to change the type of connectivity measure to be computed (ROI-to-ROI,
seed-to-voxel, or both).</p>
<p>When finished defining/exploring the connectivity analyses press Done. This will perform the defined analyses for all subjects,
constructing seed-to-voxel connectivity maps for each selected source(s), and/or complete ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrices for these
sources, for each subject and for each condition. Firstlevel results (beta maps and correlation maps when appropriate) are also
exported as nifti volumes (one per Subject/Condition/Source combination) in the results/firstlevel folder.</p>

<p>Note that the PPI/gPPI models used by CONN follow the implementation in FSL, where the interaction factor is convolved with the
hemodynamic response function and the linear interactions are modeled on the resulting BOLD-level signal; c.f. SPM-style
implementation which deconvolves the BOLD timeseries instead and the interactions are modeled on the resulting &quot;neural&quot;-level signal.
Also note that PPI effects (interaction terms in PPI model) are always relative to the baseline state (the baseline state is defined
by the zero values of the interaction term), so they provide a relative measure of connectivity characterizing differential
task-specific effects, rather than an absolute measure of connectivity such as that estimated using standard functional connectivity
analyses (e.g. weighted correlation measures).</p>
<p>As with other steps, if, at some later point after having already run this first-level analysis, you need to go back and modify any of
the information in the Setup, Denoising, or this analysis’ options in the first-level analysis tab, remember to select this
first-level analysis and click Done again in this tab in order to propagate those changes from the First-level analyses tab to the
Second-level results tab again (you may select the option ‘do not overwrite (skip already processed subjects/ROIs)’ if the
modifications in the Setup tab consisted simply in adding new subjects and/or defining new ROIs, since in those cases there is no need
to repeat this step for the already processed subjects/ROIs).</p>
<p>Group-ICA, group-PCA, fc-MVPA, and other network analyses</p>
<p>Unlike most connectivity measures (such as SBC, RRC, IC, LCOR, GCOR, etc.), where connectivity measures can be computed separately and
independently for each subject, group-ICA/PCA/MVPA analyses use information from the entire sample to then derive meaningful
subject-specific measures.</p>
<p>Group-ICA (Independent Component Analyses) identifies a number of networks of highly functionallyconnected areas. CONN’s
implementation uses Calhoun’s group-level ICA approach (Calhoun et al. 2001), with variance normalization pre-condititioning, optional
subject-level dimensionality reduction, subject/condition concatenation of BOLD signal data along temporal dimension, group-level
dimensionality reduction (to the target number of dimensions/components), fastICA for estimation of independent spatial components,
and GICA3 backprojection for individual subject-level spatial map estimation.</p>
<p>When defining a new group-ICA analysis you may edit the number of factors field to modify the number of independent components
estimated. Optionally you may also edit the 1st-level dimensionality reduction field to specify the degree of subject-level
dimensionality reduction desired (number of subject-specific SVD components retained when characterizing the voxel-to-voxel
connectivity matrix for each subject/condition; set to inf for no dimensionality reduction). Optionally check the masked analysis
checkbox and select a mask image file for masked-ICA analyses (in masked ICA the data is masked to consider only the connectivity
between voxels within the mask and voxels across the entire brain). You may also edit the choice of nonlinear contrast function in
fastICA (G1 for tanh, G2 for gauss, and G3 for pow3) and the choice of backprojection algorithm (GICA1 or GICA3).</p>
<p>Group-PCA (Principal Component Analyses) analyses are identical to group-ICA above, but skipping the fastICA reorientation of
group-level components and using instead the maximal-variance spatial components determined by a group-level dimensionality reduction
step. All other steps, including back-projection, are performed identically to group-ICA.</p>
<p>fc-MPVA (functional connectivity MultiVariate Pattern Analyses) create a set of fc-MVPA eigenpattern score maps characterizing the
connectivity patterns between each individual voxel and the rest of the brain for each individual subject and condition (this
representation is defined by performing separately for each voxel a Singular Value Decomposition of the variability in connectivity
patterns between this voxel and the rest of the brain across all subjects and conditions; see Nieto-Castanon 2022 for details). The
resulting lowdimensional representation optimally characterizes arbitrary connectivity patterns, and it allows you to investigate
connectivity differences across subjects simply running second-level multivariate analyses on the resulting eigenpattern maps.</p>
<p>When defining a new fc-MVPA analysis edit the number of factors field to modify the number of eigenpattern</p>
<p>scores computed. Keep in mind that later (during second-level analyses) you may select all or a subset of the estimated eigenpatterns
to be included in your second-level analyses. Optionally edit the 1st-level dimensionality reduction field to modify the degree of
dimensionality reduction used to characterize the voxel-to-voxel connectivity matrix for each subject (number of subject-specific SVD
components retained when characterizing this matrix; set to inf for no dimensionality reduction). Optionally check the masked analysis
checkbox and select a mask image file for masked-MVPA analyses (in masked MVPA the data is masked to consider only, at each voxel
across the entire brain, the connectivity between this voxel and voxels within the mask).</p>
<p>For all other connectivity measures derived from the voxel-to-voxel correlation matrix (IC, GCOR, LCOR, RCOR, RSIM) you may optionally
edit the 1st-level dimensionality reduction field to specify the degree of subject-level dimensionality reduction desired (number of
subject-specific SVD components retained when characterizing the voxel-to-voxel connectivity matrix separately for each
subject/condition; set to inf for no dimensionality reduction).</p>
<p>For all connectivity measures (except group-ICA/group-PCA/fc-MVPA) you may also optionally select the normalization option to convert
the distribution of computed measures across all voxels to a N(0,1) Gaussian distribution separately for each subject and condition
(this is useful, for example, when computing centrality measures and wishing to control for potential global network-cost differences
between subjects or conditions, but keep in mind that this control will remove global differences in these measures across subjects or
conditions so it may be detrimental if such global differences are meaningful).</p>
<p>In addition, for LCOR analyses you may specify the level of locality by editing the kernel size (mm) field. In these analyses each
voxel neighbourhood is defined as a probabilistic region (an isotropic Gaussian kernel with user-defined width), and you may define in
the kernel size field the size of the local averaging window (Gaussian FWHM in mm).</p>
<p>When finished defining/exploring the connectivity analyses press Done. This will perform the defined analyses for all subjects,
estimating the resulting maps for each subject and for each condition. First-level results (beta maps) are also exported as NIFTI
volumes (one per Subject/Condition/Measure combination) in the results/firstlevel folder.</p>
<p>As with other steps, if, at some later point after having already run this first-level analysis, you need to go back and modify any of
the settings or previous information (in Setup/Denoising tabs), after propagating those changes to this level click Done again in this
tab in order to propagate those changes from this Firstlevel analyses tab to the Second-level results tab again.</p>
<p>Dynamic ICA analyses</p>
<p>Dynamic connectivity analyses (Nieto-Castanon, 2016) explore dynamic properties (temporal modulation) of the ROI-to-ROI connectivity
matrix identifying a number of circuits of connections that are similarlymodulated across time. Dyn-ICA performs an Independent
Component Analysis of the connectivity timeseries (strength of connectivity between each pair of ROIs at any given timepoint),
returning a number of independent components/circuits, and associated connectivity-changes timeseries, best characterizing the
observed functional connectivity modulation across time.</p>
<p>When defining a new dyn-ICA analysis, select the ROIs to be included in this analyses in the allROIs list, and click on ‘&lt;’ to enter
these into the Sources list. Define the number of desired factors in Number of factors. Enter an optional low-pass filter threshold
value (in seconds) in smoothing kernel in order to focus the estimated temporal modulation factors on the desired low-frequency range
(similar to window-length in sliding-window approaches; set to 0s for no filtering).</p>
<p>When finished defining the dynamic analyses press Done. This will estimate the dynamic-ICA components and propagate the resulting
measures to the second-level analysis tab.</p>

<p>Methods</p>
<p>Results included in this manuscript come from analyses performed using CONN [1] (RRID:SCR_009550) release 19.a[2]  and SPM [3]
(RRID:SCR_007037) release 12.7771.</p>
<p>First-level analysis SBC: Seed-based connectivity maps (SBC) and ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrices (RRC) were estimated characterizing
the patterns of functional connectivity with 32 HPC-ICA network ROIs[2] . Functional connectivity strength was represented by
Fisher-transformed bivariate correlation coefficients from a weighted general linear model (weighted-GLM[4] ), defined separately for
each pair of seed and target areas, modeling the association between their BOLD signal timeseries. Individual scans were weighted by a
boxcar signal characterizing each individual task or experimental condition convolved with an SPM canonical hemodynamic response
function and rectified.</p>
<p>First-level analysis LCOR: Local Correlation maps (LCOR) characterizing local coherence at each voxel were estimated as the weighted
average of all short-range connections between a voxel and a 25 mm FWHM Gaussian neighborhood area[5] . Short-range connections were
computed from the matrix of bivariate correlation coefficients between the BOLD timeseries from each pair of voxels, estimated using a
singular value decomposition of the z-score normalized BOLD signal (subject-level SVD) with 64 components separately for each subject
and condition[1] .</p>

<p>Step four: second-level results (define and explore contrasts of interest</p>
<p>and group-level analyses)</p>
<p>Second-level analysis can be defined in the RESULTS (2nd -level) tab. CONN’s second-level analyses use a multivariate General Linear
Model (GLM) for modeling your data across multiple subjects, and a likelihood ratio test (LRT) for testing specific hypothesis about
the data. For a mathematical description of these analyses see Nieto-Castanon, A. (2020). General Linear Model. In Handbook of
functional connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging methods in CONN (pp. 63–82). Hilbert Press.</p>
<p>The options below apply to all second-level analyses in CONN, irrespective of the type of first-level connectivity measure used (e.g.
for the analyses of SBC connectivity maps, RRC connectivity matrices, etc.)</p>
<p>A second-level model can be defined in CONN by selecting the corresponding descriptive question in the blue area. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘does the average connectivity differ from zero?’ will perform a one-sample t-test across all subjects</p></li>
<li><p>‘does the average connectivity within MALE subjects differ from zero?’ will perform a one-sample t-test across all male subjects</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(this question will be available only when you have defined in the Setup.Covariates (2nd -level) tab one group covariate -with 0/1
values only -, in this example a MALE group covariates)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘does the average connectivity differ between MALE and FEMALE subjects?’ will perform a two-sample t-test (this question will be</p></li>
</ul>
<p>available only when you have defined in the Setup.Covariates (2nd -level) tab two non-overlapping group covariates, in this example
MALE and FEMALE group covariates)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘does the correlation between connectivity and AGE differ from zero?’ will perform a bivariate regression analysis (this question</p></li>
</ul>
<p>will be available only when you have defined in the Setup.Covariates (2nd -level) tab a continuous covariate, in this example AGE)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘does the connectivity differences between MALE and FEMALE subjects depend on AGE?’ will perform a test of sex-by-age interactions</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(this question will be available only when the three variables above have been defined in Setup.Covariates (2nd -level) as well as
their interactions terms -e.g. by selecting those three covariates and then click on ‘covariate tools. Create interaction(s) of
selected covariates’ in the same Setup.Covariates (2nd -level) tab)</p>
<p>In addition, you may also select additional control variables for your analyses by clicking on the ‘…’ menu within the blue area and
selecting the associated 2nd -level covariates (defined in Setup.Covariates (2nd -level), and characterizing any continuous or group
variable).</p>
<p>In addition, if you have multiple conditions, you may also select a description of what aspects of your conditions you would like to
test in the second prompt within the blue area. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘Analysis of seed-based connectivity change between PRE and POST’ together with ‘does the average connectivity-change differ from</p></li>
</ul>
<p>zero?’ will perform a paired t-test comparing connectivity across the PRE and POST conditions (this question will be available only
when your project has defined in Setup.Conditions two different conditions, in this example PRE and POST conditions)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘Analysis of seed-based connectivity change between PRE and POST’ together with ‘does the average connectivity-change differ between</p></li>
</ul>
<p>MALE and FEMALE subjects?’ will test the time-bysex interaction in a mixed within/between subjects ANOVA (this question will be
available only when your project has defined in Setup.Conditions two different conditions, in this example PRE and POST conditions, as
well as two non-overlapping groups covariates in Setup.Covariates (2nd level), in this example MALE and FEMALE covariates)</p>
<p>Last, if you have multiple first-level analyses, you may also select the name of your 1st -level analysis in the first prompt of the
blue area to apply the same test to different connectivity measures.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you prefer, you may define the same analyses (instead of by selecting the corresponding descriptive question in the
blue area) by manually selecting the 2nd -level covariates that you would like to include in your model in the ‘subject effects’ list
below that, and specifying a contrast across these selected covariates in the ‘between-subjects contrast’ field (e.g. select PATIENTS
and CONTROLS and enter a [-1 1] contrast to compare the two groups). If you have multiple conditions, you may also manually select the
conditions that you would like to include in your analysis in the ‘conditions’ list and specify the corresponding contrast across the
selected conditions in the ‘between-conditions contrast’ field (e.g. select conditions TASK and REST and enter a [1 -1] contrast to
compare the two conditions). Similarly, in SBC analyses, multiple ROIs/sources can be selected simultaneously in order to analyze
connectivity results across several seeds/ROIs by specifying the contrast in ‘between source contrast” (e.g. select both “PCC” and
“Angular Gyrus” sources and enter a [1 -1] contrast to compare the connectivity between these two seeds, or enter [1,0; 0,1] contrast
to investigate regions functionally connected to any of these two seeds).</p>
<p>Each of these contrasts (between-subjects, between-conditions, and between-sources) can be defined as a single vector (e.g. [1,-1],
for T-statistics) or as matrix (e.g. [1,0; 0,1], for F-statistics, where multiple contrasts are entered separated by ‘;’). In general,
contrast matrices containing several rows are equivalent to an OR conjunction test on any of the individual row contrasts.</p>
<p>Both between-condition and between-source contrasts represent within-subject effects and the second-level analyses will correspond to
multivariate/repeated-measures analyses of the selected effects. Specifically, the second-level model will be a general linear model
that includes as regressors the selected terms in the “Subject effects” list. The outcome variable will be the within-subjects linear
combination(s) of effects specified by the “between-conditions” and ”between-sources” contrasts, applied to the first-level
connectivity-measure volumes (for the seed-to-voxel analyses) or to the first-level connectivity-measure matrix (for the ROI-toROI
analyses). For F-contrasts, voxel-level analyses are implemented as repeated-measures analyses using ReML estimation of covariance
components and evaluated through F-statistical parameter maps, and ROIlevel analyses are implemented as multivariate analyses and
evaluated through F- or Wilks lambda statistics depending on the dimensionality of the within- and between- subjects contrasts. The
following table illustrates a few common second-level design examples:</p>
<p>ROI-to-ROI analyses (ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity matrices)</p>
<p>When selecting ROI-to-ROI Connectivity analyses in the results (2nd -level) tab (or when selecting any other first-level connectivity
measure that also computes ROI-to-ROI maps), the default behavior is to perform analyses encompassing the entire ROI-to-ROI
connectivity matrix. After selecting the desired type of analyses (e.g. specifying the subject-effects, between-subject contrasts,
etc.) select the option Group-analysis results (all ROIs) and click on compute results to compute this 2nd -level analysis (or display
results to display the results if these analyses have already been computed). That will launch a results explorer window where you can
specify your choice of inferential method and error rate threshold used to display the results:</p>
<p>ROI-to-ROI results explorer window</p>
<p>By default the results explorer window uses FNC (functional network connectivity) to identify significant effects within clusters of
connections, while appropriately correcting for multiple comparisons in the context of the entire set of ROI-to-ROI connections
evaluated. Click on ‘standard settings for cluster-based</p>
<p>inferences #1: functional network connectivity’ if you prefer to select a different approach. Available inferential methods are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>standard settings for cluster-based inferences #1: functional network connectivity. Significance is determined at the level of</p></li>
</ul>
<p>clusters/groups of connections. Clusters of connections are defined using a hierarchical clustering approach to first group ROIs into
meaningful networks (groups of ROIs), and then grouping all connections between the same two networks (for each pair of networks,
including within- and between- network connectivity). Results are corrected across multiple comparisons using FDR across the entire
set of possible pairwise clusters.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>standard settings for cluster-based inferences #2: spatial pairwise clustering. Significance is determined at the level of</p></li>
</ul>
<p>clusters/groups of connections. Clusters of connections are defined as connected components in the 2D binary image resulting from
thresholding the ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix at some user-defined connection-level threshold. The ROI-to-ROI matrix is sorted
automatically to take into account functional similarity between ROIs and anatomical proximity. Results are corrected across multiple
comparisons by performing randomization/permutation analyses.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>standard settings for cluster-based inferences #3: threshold free cluster enhancement. Significance is determined at the level of</p></li>
</ul>
<p>clusters/groups of connections. Clusters of connections are defined as connected components in the 2D binary image resulting from
thresholding the ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix at a TFCE threshold (TFCE scores at each connection combine connection and cluster
statistics into a single measure). The appropriate TFCE threshold is determined using randomization/permutation analyses, to guarantee
the desired maximum familywise error rate.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Alternative settings for connection-level inferences: parametric univariate statistics. Significance is determined at the level of</p></li>
</ul>
<p>individual connections. Results are corrected across multiple comparisons using FDR across the entire set of possible pairwise

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Alternative settings for ROI-level inferences: parametric multivariate statistics. Significance is determined at the level of</p></li>

<p>individual ROIs (considering the cluster/group of connections between a given ROI and all other ROIs). Results are corrected across
multiple comparisons using FDR across the entire set of ROIs.</p>

</ul>
<p>networks (considering the cluster/group of connections defined as connected subgraphs within the graph of all suprathreshold
ROI-to-ROI connections). Results are corrected across multiple comparisons using randomization/permutation analyses.</p>
<p>For any of the above methods you may click on the ‘show details’ checkbox to display and modify any of the individual parameters used
in these options (e.g. individual connection-level thresholds, cluster-level p-values, etc.). For more mathematical details about any
of the above methods, see Nieto-Castanon, A. (2020). Cluster-level inferences. In Handbook of functional connectivity Magnetic
Resonance Imaging methods in CONN (pp. 83–104). Hilbert Press. doi:10.56441/hilbertpress.2207.6603</p>
<p>Click on ‘analysis of ### connections among ### ROIs’ if you want to restrict the ROI-to-ROI matrix to only consider the connections
between a subset of ROIs.</p>
<p>Click on ‘ROIs sorted using hierarchical clustering’ for methods #1-#3 above if you prefer to sort (for methods #2 or #3) or cluster
(for method #1) the ROIs in your ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix differently.</p>
<p>Click on individual clusters in the bottom list to select individual clusters of significant connections. The following methods are
available for displaying only the selected significant clusters / connections:</p>
<p>ring display shows connections among all ROIs distributed in a ring matrix display shows the ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix
connections display shows a graphical list of all significant connections brain display shows connections as lines between ROIs
displayed in the brain</p>
<p>ring display</p>
<p>connections display</p>
<p>matrix display</p>
<p>brain display</p>
<p>Click on ‘import values’ to import individual connectivity values within each significant connection separately for each subject into
your CONN project as a set of new second-level covariates.</p>
<p>Click on ‘export mask’ to export a matrix NIFTI file containing the mask of suprathreshold connections in these second-level analysis
results Click on ‘export data’ to export this analysis’ data as a 4D matrix NIFTI file the data (ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrices for
each subject and condition)</p>
<p>Click on ‘plot effects’ to compute effect-sizes (e.g. connectivity values within each group) averaged across all connections within
each significant cluster</p>
<p>ROI-to-ROI analyses (connectivity with individual ROIs)</p>
<p>When selecting ROI-to-ROI analyses in the results (2nd -level) tab, it is also possible to perform analysis restricted to the
connectivity between an individual ROI and all of the other ROIs. After selecting the desired type of analyses (e.g. specifying the
subject-effects, between-subject contrasts, etc.) select the option Groupanalysis results (individual ROIs) to compute this 2nd -level
analysis.</p>
<p>In the ‘Seed/Sources’ list select the individual seed that you would like to analyze. The brain display at the right shows an axial
view of the ROI-to-ROI second-level analysis results estimated in real time for the selected seed ROI. These results can be
thresholded at the desired p-value threshold, using uncorrected p-values or FDR-corrected p-values (corrected for multiple comparisons
across all of the selected target ROIs; use p-FDR&lt;0.05 for appropriate multiple comparisons correction only for this individual
analysis).</p>
<p>The list at the bottom of this figure shows the statistics associated with the analysis of the connectivity between the chosen seed
ROI and each individual target ROI. Right-click on this list if you wish to restrict the list of target ROIs being included in this
analysis to a different set of ROIs (this choice affects the FDRcorrected p-values of the results).</p>
<p>Images are displayed in neurological format. Select Display 3d to view a 3d-rendered display of the suprathreshold ROI-level results.
For each target ROI the list at the bottom of the figure displays the connectivity contrast effect sizes (between the selected source
–or linear combination of sources- and each target), as well as T/F/X- values, uncorrected p-values, and FDR-corrected p- values for
the specified second-level analysis. Right-clicking on this table allows you to export this table to a .txt, .csv, or .mat file.
Select Display Values or Import Values to display/import the estimated ROI-to-ROI connectivity values for each subject and for each
selected condition between the selected seed and target ROIs. Importing these values will create new second-level covariates
containing these connectivity values for each subject for further analyses.</p>
<p>ROI-to-ROI analyses (graph measures)</p>
<p>When selecting ROI-to-ROI analyses in the results (2nd -level) tab, it is also possible to perform graphanalysis of the resulting
ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrices. After selecting the desired type of analyses (e.g. specifying the subject-effects, between-subject
contrasts, etc.) click on Graph theory results to compute this 2nd -level analysis on the available graph measures.</p>
<p>graph theory results explorer window</p>
<p>Last by clicking graph-theory a graphical display is shown allowing the users to test (for the selected between-subjects and
between-condition contrasts) measures of efficiency, centrality, and cost/degree, associated with an ROI-to-ROI connectivity network.
Click on ‘Network nodes’ to limit the ROI-to-ROI network analyzed to that defined by a subset of ROIs. The ‘Network edges’ option
allows the definition of the connectivity threshold above which two ROIs are considered connected, and it can be defined based on
correlation scores, zscores, or cost values. For each ROI the list at the bottom of the figure displays the corresponding measure
effect size (global efficiency, local effiency, or cost), as well as T- values, uncorrected p-values, and FDR-corrected p- values for
the specified second-level analysis. The graphical display and second-level results can be thresholded using either uncorrected or
FDR-corrected p- values, and it can be set to display one-sided or two-sided results. Right-clicking on the brain display shows
additional display options, including 3d-rendered views of the analyzed network of connectivity.</p>
<p>Seed-Based Connectivity analyses (functional connectivity maps)</p>
<p>When selecting Seed-Based Connectivity analyses in the results (2nd -level) tab (or when selecting any other first-level connectivity
measure that also computes voxel-level maps), after selecting the desired type of analyses (e.g. specifying the subject-effects,
between-subject contrasts, etc.) click on compute results to compute this 2nd -level analysis (or display results to display the
results if these analyses have already been computed). That will launch a results explorer window where you can specify your choice of
inferential method and error rate threshold used to display the results:</p>
<p>Voxel-level results explorer window</p>
<p>By default the results explorer window uses RFT (random field theory) parametric statistics to identify significant effects within
clusters of voxels, while appropriately correcting for multiple comparisons across</p>
<p>the entire brain. Click on ‘standard settings for cluster-based inferences #1: random field theory parametric statistics’ if you
prefer to select a different approach. Available inferential methods are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>standard settings for cluster-based inferences #1: random field theory parametric statistics. Significance is determined at the</p></li>
</ul>
<p>level of clusters/groups of voxels. Clusters are defined as connected components in the 3D binary image resulting from thresholding
the voxel-level statistics at some user-defined voxel-level threshold. Results are corrected across multiple comparisons using FWE or
FDR across the entire set of voxels within the analysis mask (whole brain).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>standard settings for cluster-based inferences #2: permutation/randomization analyses. Same options as above, but cluster-level</p></li>

<p>thresholded using a TFCE threshold (TFCE scores combine voxel and cluster statistics into a single measure). The appropriate TFCE
threshold is determined using randomization/permutation analyses, to guarantee the desired maximum familywise error rate.</p>
<p>For any of the above methods you may click on the ‘show details’ checkbox to display and modify any of the individual parameters used
in these options (e.g. individual voxel-level thresholds, cluster-level p- values, etc.). For more mathematical details about any of
the above methods, see Nieto-Castanon, A. (2020). Clusterlevel inferences. In Handbook of functional connectivity Magnetic Resonance
Imaging methods in CONN (pp. 83–104). Hilbert Press. doi:10.56441/hilbertpress.2207.6603</p>
<p>Click on individual clusters in the bottom list to select significant clusters. The following methods are available for displaying
only the selected significant clusters / areas:</p>
<p>surface display shows areas projected on the cortical surface of an ICBM template brain volume display shows areas as 3D ‘blobs’</p>
<p>slice display shows areas across individual slices of an ICBM template T1w structural image glass display shows areas in MIP

<p>When clicking on ‘display network’ a window appears where you may select your choice of subjects (or between-subjects contrast),
conditions, and display type you would like to use when displaying connectivity between the selected clusters and the rest of the
brain. For example, the default options (shown in image below) will display the connectivity between the selected cluster and the rest
of the brain, computed during the rest condition, averaged across all subjects, and shown projected onto the cortical surface.</p>

<p>Click on ‘plot effects’ to compute effect-sizes (e.g. connectivity values within each group) averaged across all voxels within each
significant cluster</p>
<p>Group-ICA analyses</p>
<p>Select ICA.Summary to explore the estimated ICA networks/components. The top-left table lists several properties of each network
(spatial variability/kurtosis/skewness, and temporal variability/frequency). The top-right display shows the group-level maps (ICA
spatial components) for the selected networks/components. These maps may be thresholded based on a z-score threshold for display
purposes (factor loadings are centered and normalized across all voxels to compute z-scores). The bottom display shows the BOLD signal
timeseries associated with each network (ICA temporal components) for the selected subject/condition. By default ICA components are
sorted by their relative overlap with gray matter areas (last networks/components may be loading more heavily on white or CSF areas,
which are often identified as noise components)</p>
<p>networks match-to-template summary display</p>
<p>In addition selecting ICA tools. Spatial match to template computes the correlation between each grouplevel spatial map and a CONN’s
default networks file or a user-defined mask file, which can be used to identify networks of interest. In addition, hovering over the
top-right plot displays the factor loadings at each</p>
<p>voxel, as well as the networks/components with the highest loadings at each voxel, which is another common way to identify networks of
interest. The top-right display can also be selected to show the associated ICA parcellation maps. Parcellations are computed by
finding, among the selected networks/components, the one that shows the highest factor loading at each voxel, and thresholding the
resulting maps using the chosen zscore threshold. Parcellations may be computed across all networks/components or only across a subset
of the estimated networks simply by selecting the desired subset of networks in the top-left table. The resulting parcellations can
also be exported to a file (e.g. to be used as ROIs) by selecting the ICA tools. Create ICA parcellation ROI file option.</p>
<p>Tip: some times it is desirable to define ROIs from some or all of the ICA networks for additional analyses (e.g. within- and between-
network connectivity analyses, ICA denoising, etc.) There are three ways in CONN to define meaningful ROIs from ICA results (and all
of these methods are commonly used in the literature):</p>
<p>1) thresholded second-level analyses: from ICA.SpatialComponent analyses (see section below), in the results explorer window define
the desired thresholds (e.g. in terms of T- statistics from a one-sample t-test of the individual subject-level maps) and use ‘export
mask’ to create a mask of suprathreshold areas, then in Setup.ROIs import the resulting mask.ROI.nii file as a new ROI atlas file</p>
<p>2) thresholded group-level maps: from the ICA.Summary tab, select one or several networks, define the desired zscore threshold, and
use ‘ICA tools. Create ICA parcellation file’ to create a new ROI file, then again import the resulting file in Setup.ROIs as a new
ROI atlas file</p>
<p>and 3) weighted/unthresholded group-level maps: in Setup.ROIs select ‘ROI tools. Add ICA-network ROIs’ to define a new set of ROIs
directly form the group-level spatial masks, using these maps as weighted/probabilisticROIs (one ROI per network)</p>
<p>Generally the advantage of method (3) is that the resulting ROI timeseries and connectivity maps more closely represent the properties
of the networks identified in the ICA procedure (when using this method, the extracted ROI timeseries for each network will be exactly
the same as the ICA temporal component timeseries, and if using these ROIs as seeds in multivariate analyses the resulting
seed-to-voxel maps will be exactly the same as the individual subject-level spatial maps estimated in the ICA procedure for each
network), while the advantage of methods (1) and (2) is that they allow breaking individual networks into potentially multiple
separate clusters/areas (e.g. for additional within-network or between-network connectivity analyses).</p>
<p>Select ICA.SpatialComponents to analyze the subject-level maps for each network/component. Secondlevel analyses can be defined in the
same way as for any other voxel-level measure (e.g. seed-to-voxel connectivity maps). These analyses enter the estimated subject-level
spatial maps for each subject/condition/network into standard second-level analyses in order, for example, to display the average map
across all subjects for a given network, or compare these networks across subjects and/or conditions. Select compute results to
perform the desired second-level analyses, threshold the resulting statistical maps using a combination of height- and extent-
thresholds, perform non-parametric analyses, or additional display and analysis options.</p>
<p>Select ICA.TemporalComponents to analyze properties of the BOLD signal timeseries associated with each network/component. For each
network/component, the temporal variability as well as the frequency (center of mass in spectral power) of these BOLD signal
timeseries are computed for each subject and for each condition. Second-level analyses can be defined in the same way as for any other
individual measure, for example, to compute the average of these measures across all subjects or to compare these measures across
subjects or conditions.</p>
<p>fc-MVPA analyses</p>
<p>Select MVPA.Summary to explore the entire functional connectome (voxel-to-voxel connectivity values) and characterize its diversity
across subjects and/or conditions using the estimated fc-MVPA eigenpattern scores.</p>
<p>Click (or click and drag) on the left display to select a seed voxel. The display in the middle will change accordingly to show the
connectivity with that seed voxel, for the selected condition (e.g. during rest, when selecting in the ‘conditions’ list the rest
condition) and the selected subjects (e.g. averaged across all subjects, when selecting in the ‘Subjects’ list the ‘All Subjects’
option). In addition to describing the seed-based connectivity map on average / commonly across all subjects, this display can also be
used to identify the principal axes of variability across subjects and/or across conditions in these seed-based connectivity maps.
These principal axes of variability are characterized by fc-MVPA separately for each seed voxel as a set of eigenpatterns (principal
components of the functional connectivity with that voxel across subjects and conditions), and they can be displayed by selecting in
the ‘Subjects’ list the ’Low- and High-scoring subjects’ option and then selecting in the ‘fc-MVPA scores’ list an individual
eigenpattern (numbered from 1 to the total number of components estimated by fc-MVPA). The display in the middle will then show two
seed-based connectivity maps, computed as the average seed-based connectivity separately for subjects above the median score
(high-scoring subjects) or below it (low-scoring subjects). Differences between these two groups of subjects characterize what aspects
of functional connectivity differ the most between subjects or conditions. You can also select the option ‘High vs. Low
between-subjects contrast’ to only display the difference in connectivity between these two groups of subjects, or the ‘High-scoring
subjects’ or ‘Low-scoring subjects’ to display these two groups separately (in addition this GUI can also be used to define any
arbitrary secondlevel contrast across the same seed-based connectivity maps by selecting the ‘Custom between-subjects contrast’
option; e.g. to look at the association between seed-based connectivity with an individual voxel and a behavioral variable).</p>
<p>In addition you may select display 3D to compute these maps across the entire brain and display them projected onto the 3D cortical
surface (this will also generate a NIFTI file containing these maps for additional analyses and/or exporting them to other software
packages). Select export data to export NIFTI files containing the original seed-based connectivity maps for the selected seed voxel
separately for each individual subject, or select import values to import the selected eigenpattern scores for each subject for the
selected seed as a new 2nd -level covariate (available in Setup.Covariates 2nd -level).</p>
<p>Select MVPA.Group-analyses to perform brain-wide connectome inferences, evaluating differences between subjects and/or conditions in
the entire functional connectome.</p>
<p>Second-level analyses can be defined in the same way as for any other voxel-level measure (e.g. seed-tovoxel connectivity maps). These
analyses enter the estimated subject-level eigenpattern score maps for each subject/condition/network into standard second-level
analyses as a proxy for the entire functional connectome in order analyze the connectivity patterns at all voxels across subjects
and/or conditions. Results will indicate those voxels where the connectivity between those voxels and the rest of the brain show a
significant effect across subjects or across conditions (e.g. a significant difference between two groups of subjects in functional
connectivity).</p>
<p>Select the desired number of eigenpatterns in the MVPA components list (e.g. selecting the component 10 will enter the first 10
components in your fc-MVPA second-level analysis). The recommended value to include in 2nd -level analysis is 10 (with lower values if
needed to keep at least a 10:1 ratio between subjects and components; see fc-MVPA manuscript for details)</p>
<p>After selecting the desired type of analyses (e.g. specifying the subject-effects, between-subject contrasts, etc.) click on compute
results to compute this 2nd -level analysis (or display results to display the results if these analyses have already been computed).
That will launch a results explorer window where you can specify your choice of inferential method and error rate threshold used to
display the fc-MVPA results (the recommended setting for fc-MVPA inferences are the non-parametric options ‘standard settings for
clusterbased inferences #2: permutation/randomization analyses’ or ‘standard settings for cluster-based inferences #3: threshold free
cluster enhancement’).</p>
<p>Supra-threshold clusters in this display will indicate those areas with significant functional connectivity effects (e.g. significant
differences between two groups). In addition, to display effect-sizes, describing the specific effects found within each individual
cluster (e.g. differences in connectivity between two groups in the connectivity between an individual cluster and the rest of the
brain), select a significant cluster and then click on the ‘Network view’ option. Change the ‘subjects’ option to ‘display same
between-subjects contrast as in current analysis’ and then click ‘Ok’.</p>
<p>Dynamic ICA analyses</p>
<p>Select dyn-ICA.Summary to explore the estimated dynamic circuits/components. The top-left table lists several properties of each
circuit (spatial variability/kurtosis/skewness, and temporal variability/frequency). The top-right display shows the group-level maps
(ICA spatial components) for the selected circuits/components. These maps represent an ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix with the factor
loadings associated with each individual connection for each circuit color coded. These maps may be thresholded based on a z-score
threshold for display purposes (factor loadings are centered and normalized across all connections to compute z-scores). The bottom
display shows the connectivity modulation timeseries associated with each circuit (ICA temporal components) for the selected
subject/condition. Hovering over the top-right plot displays the factor loadings at each connection, as well as the
circuits/components with the highest loadings for each connection, which can be used to identify circuits of interest.</p>
<p>The top-right display can also be selected to show the associated estimated dynamic connectivity. From the estimated ICA decomposition
the connectivity timeseries can be reconstructed showing the ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix at each timepoint during each subject
scan. The top-right display shows in this case the estimated ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix modulation over time, and the bottom plot
shows the ROI-to-ROI connectivity values over time for any selected connection (ROI pair). Select in the ‘Subjects’ list the desired
subject to display. You may switch between displaying the full connectivity at each timepoint or only the contribution from one or a
subset of circuits/components (by selecting the ‘display the selected circuit(s) contribution only’ option). Click on ‘Play’ to browse
through the selected subject scans displaying the observed dynamic connectivity matrix at each timepoint.</p>
<p>Select dyn-ICA.SpatialComponents to analyze the subject-level connectivity matrices for each circuit/component. These connectivity
matrices define circuits / groups of connections, that share similar changes in functional connectivity across time. Second-level
analyses can be defined in the same way as for any other ROI-to-ROI measure. These analyses enter the estimated subject-level spatial
maps (representing ROI-to-ROI connectivity modulation matrices) for each subject/condition/circuit into standard second-level analyses
in order, for example, to display the average map across all subjects for a given circuit, or compare these circuits across subjects
and/or conditions. Select compute results to perform the desired second-level analyses across all ROIs, threshold the resulting
statistical maps using a combination of connection- and seed- or network- level thresholds, perform non-parametric analyses, or
additional display and analysis options. You may also select Graph Theory to perform additional analyses of network-theoretical
measures of the resulting circuits across subjects and/or conditions.</p>
<p>Select dyn-ICA.TemporalComponents to analyze properties of the connectivity-modulation timeseries associated with each
circuit/component. For each circuit/component, the temporal average, temporal variability, as well as the frequency (center of mass in
spectral power) of these connectivity-modulation timeseries are computed for each subject and for each condition. Second-level
analyses can be defined in the same way as for any other individual measure to, for example, compute the average of these measures
across all subjects or compare these measures across subjects or conditions.</p>

<p>Methods</p>
<p>Results included in this manuscript come from analyses performed using CONN [1] (RRID:SCR_009550) release 19.a[2]  and SPM [3]
(RRID:SCR_007037) release 12.7771.</p>
<p>Group-level analyses were performed using a General Linear Model (GLM[4] ). For each individual voxel a separate GLM was estimated,
with first-level connectivity measures at this voxel as dependent variables (one independent sample per subject and one measurement
per task or experimental condition, if applicable), and groups or other subject-level identifiers as independent variables.
Voxel-level hypotheses were evaluated using multivariate parametric statistics with random-effects across subjects and sample
covariance estimation across multiple measurements. Inferences were performed at the level of individual clusters (groups of
contiguous voxels). Cluster-level inferences were based on parametric statistics from Gaussian Random Field theory[5,6] . Results were
thresholded using a combination of a clusterforming p &lt; 0.001 voxel-level threshold, and a familywise corrected p-FDR &lt; 0.05
cluster-size threshold[7] .</p>
